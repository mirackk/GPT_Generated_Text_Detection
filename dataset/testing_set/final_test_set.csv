"Brazilians represent approximately 25% of the foreign population in Portugal, making them the second largest immigrant group after the Portuguese. Brazilians are well-integrated into Portuguese society and enjoy a good relationship with the Portuguese minority in Brazil.

Brazilians first began arriving in Portugal in the late 1960s as a result of the country's booming economy. Since then, the number of Brazilian residents has steadily increased, primarily due to Portuguese citizens returning to Brazil in search of employment. Today, there are around 350,000 Brazilians living in Portugal, making them the second largest immigrant group after the Portuguese.

Brazilians in Portugal typically find work in the agricultural, hospitality and construction sectors. In addition, many Brazilian residents have established businesses in Portugal's burgeoning tourism sector. Brazilians are also well-represented in academia, with a number of universities and colleges employing Brazilian faculty.

The Brazilian community in Portugal is vibrant and active, with a wide range of social and cultural organizations available to members. The Brazilian community is also well-integrated into Portuguese society, with relatively little tension between Brazilians and the Portuguese majority.",1

"Thyrium or Thyrion , or Thyreum or Thyreon (Θύρεον), or Thurium or Thourion (Θούριον), or Thyrreium or Thyrreion (Θύρρειον), was a city in ancient Acarnania. Cicero tells us that in sailing from Alyzia to Leucas, he touched at Thyrium, where he remained two hours; and from this statement, as well as from the history of the events in which Thyrium is mentioned, we may infer that it was situated on or near the Ionian Sea, and that it was the first town on the coast south of the channel which separated Leucas from the mainland. Thyrium is first mentioned in 373 BCE, when its territory was invaded by Iphicrates. Xenophon describes it as a place of importance; and it appears as one of the chief cities of Acarnania at the time of the Roman wars in Greece, when its name frequently occurs. When Acarnania allied itself with Philip V of Macedon against Rome in 200 BCE, although it lost Leucas because of this, and the city of Thyrreion was anointed as its new capital. At this period Thyrium was one of the places at which the meetings of the Acarnanian League were usually held.

"Dunite , also known as olivinite (not to be confused with the mineral olivenite), is an intrusive igneous rock of ultramafic composition and with phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture. The mineral assemblage is greater than 90% olivine, with minor amounts of other minerals such as pyroxene, chromite, magnetite, and pyrope. Dunite is the olivine-rich endmember of the peridotite group of mantle-derived rocks. Dunite and other peridotite rocks are considered the major constituents of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about . Dunite is rarely found within continental rocks, but where it is found, it typically occurs at the base of ophiolite sequences where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone have been thrust onto continental crust by obduction during continental or island arc collisions (orogeny). It is also found in alpine peridotite massifs that represent slivers of sub-continental mantle exposed during collisional orogeny. Dunite typically undergoes retrograde metamorphism in near-surface environments and is altered to serpentinite and soapstone.",0

"Cannabis has been cultivated in Japan since the Jōmon period of Japanese prehistory approximately six to ten thousand years ago. As one of the earliest cultivated plants in Japan, cannabis hemp was an important source of plant fiber used to produce clothing, cordage, and items for Shinto rituals, among numerous other uses. Hemp remained ubiquitous for its fabric and as a foodstuff for much of Japanese history, before cotton emerged as the country's primary fiber crop amid industrialization during the Meiji period.

"Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 539 (1842), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 precluded a Pennsylvania state law that prohibited blacks from being taken out of the free state of Pennsylvania into slavery. The Court overturned the conviction of slavecatcher Edward Prigg as a result. Occurring under the presidency of John Tyler, Prigg v. Pennsylvania weakened the enforcement mechanisms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 by allowing states to forbid their officials from cooperating in the return of fugitive slaves. But, by asserting federal government authority and responsibility over the area of fugitive slave return, it set the stage for future more stringent laws that would bypass individual state decisions about slavery. (Northern states by this time had abolished slavery, and most prohibited slaveowners from bringing slaves to their states, saying they would be considered free if brought in state.) Later, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 (part of the Compromise of 1850), required even free states to support capture and return of fugitive slaves with their law enforcement, increasing penalties for non-compliance.",0

"Convective storm detection is the meteorological observation, and short-term prediction, of deep moist convection (DMC). DMC describes atmospheric conditions producing single or clusters  of large vertical extension clouds ranging from cumulus congestus to cumulonimbus, the latter producing thunderstorms associated with lightning and thunder. Those two types of clouds can produce severe weather at the surface and aloft. The ability to discern the presence of deep moist convection in a storm significantly improves meteorologists' capacity to predict and monitor associated phenomena such as tornadoes, large hail, strong winds, and heavy rain leading to flash flooding. It relies on direct eyewitness observations, for example from storm spotters; and on remote sensing, especially weather radar. Some in situ measurements are used for direct detection as well, notably, wind speed reports from surface observation stations. It is part of the integrated warning system, consisting of prediction, detection, and dissemination of information on severe weather to users such as emergency management, storm spotters and chasers, the media, and the general public.",0

"In Islamic cultures of the Middle East, North Africa, Sicily and South Asia, a Diwan (, divân, , dīwān) is a collection of poems by one author, usually excluding his or her long poems (mathnawī). These poems, frequently sung or set to music, were often composed and collected in the imperial courts of various sultanates and were very well known for their ability to inspire. In modern-times, the inspirational, linguistic, verse, meter, and other design features of the Diwan or Masnavi poetry, are found echoing in other cultures, same or similar to the relaying of hidden messages, safety, and support, left for those ex-slaves on the Underground Railroad, during the American Civil War. Thus, themes that emerge from traditional Islamic origins can again portray of and evoke the persistence of life, or whatever continuances, admirable to the old or traditional ways and wisdoms. Where these are found in freeform variants, like an enigma, the modern Diwan, as powers brings a peculiar message encompassing for the divinities. The vast majority of Diwan poetry was lyric in nature: either  ghazals or gazels (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasîdes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnevî, a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry; the two most notable examples of this form are the Layla and Majnun (ليلى و مجنون) of Fuzûlî and the Hüsn ü Aşk (حسن و عشق; ""Beauty and Love"") of Şeyh Gâlib.",0
"Fort Allen (also known as ""Truby's Blockhouse"") was a military structure which was built in Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County in the Province of Pennsylvania by Colonel Christopher Truby of Pennsylvania's colonial militia. Erected in 1774 in response to a threatened attack by Indians upon German pioneers who had settled in the area, it became a frontier fort of Dunmore's War in 1774, and also was used as a fort during the American Revolution in which Truby also served as an officer with the Continental Army. History
Following a series of attacks during the 1750s by Indians on German pioneers and other immigrants who had begun relocating to, and settling in, various parts of Pennsylvania, including west of the Susquehanna River, colonial government leaders began receiving petitions from hundreds of those settlers for protection. In response, the Province of Pennsylvania spent eighty-five thousand pounds to erect a chain of blockhouses and forts along the Kittanning Hills from the Delaware River to the province's border with Maryland. Those military installations were then manned with between 20 to 75 members of the provincial militia. ",0

"The rule of law is the political philosophy that all citizens and institutions within a country, state, or community are accountable to the same laws. The rule of law is defined in the Encyclopedia Britannica as ""the mechanism, process, institution, practice, or norm that supports the equality of all citizens before the law, secures a nonarbitrary form of government, and more generally prevents the arbitrary use of power."" The term rule of law is closely related to constitutionalism as well as Rechtsstaat and refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule. Use of the phrase can be traced to 16th-century Britain. In the following century, the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it in arguing against the divine right of kings. John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty.  ""The rule of law"" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers. Aristotle wrote: ""It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens.""",0

The law was challenged on the grounds that it was unconstitutional because it did not provide information about all of the voting rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The Court held that the law was constitutional because it provided information about the right to vote in language that was clear and concise.",1

"Jack Beaver (27 March 1900 – 10 September 1963) was a British film score composer and pianist. Beaver was born in Clapham, London. He studied at the Metropolitan Academy of Music, Forest Gate and then at the Royal Academy of Music under Frederick Corder. After graduating he worked for the BBC. In the early 1930s he played with the Michael Doré Trio and wrote some concert pieces, including the three movement Sonatina for piano. He also contributed music and arrangements for various BBC radio drama and music features, including most of the radio adaptions of films in collaboration with producer Douglas Moodie, throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As (like Charles Williams) a member of the Gaumont–British Pictures composing team from the 1930s he was a prolific composer of film scores - around 40 scores between 1932 and 1947 - though many of his contributions were not credited. He wrote music for Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, and composed the pseudo piano concerto Portrait of Isla from the score for the 1940 Edgar Wallace film The Case of the Frightened Lady. This is perhaps the first example of a Romantic style ""Denham Concerto"" (or sometimes ""tabloid piano concerto"") composed especially for a film, a year before Richard Addinsell's much more famous Warsaw Concerto appeared in the film Dangerous Moonlight (1941).",0

"In semiconductor manufacturing, a low-κ is a material with a small relative dielectric constant (κ, kappa) relative to silicon dioxide. Low-κ dielectric material implementation is one of several strategies used to allow continued scaling of microelectronic devices, colloquially referred to as extending Moore's law. In digital circuits, insulating dielectrics separate the conducting parts (wire interconnects and transistors) from one another. As components have scaled and transistors have gotten closer together, the insulating dielectrics have thinned to the point where charge build up and crosstalk adversely affect the performance of the device. Replacing the silicon dioxide with a low-κ dielectric of the same thickness reduces parasitic capacitance, enabling faster switching speeds and lower heat dissipation.
In conversation such materials may be referred to as ""low-k"" (spoken ""low kay"") rather than ""low-κ"" (low-kappa). Low-κ materials
In integrated circuits, and CMOS devices, silicon dioxide can readily be formed on surfaces of Si through thermal oxidation, and can further be deposited on the surfaces of conductors using chemical vapor deposition or various other thin film fabrication methods. Due to the wide range of methods that can be used to cheaply form silicon dioxide layers, this material is used conventionally as the baseline to which other low permittivity dielectrics are compared. The relative dielectric constant of SiO2, the insulating material still used in silicon chips, is 3.9. This number is the ratio of the permittivity of SiO2 divided by permittivity of vacuum, εSiO2/ε0, where ε0 = 8.854×10−6 pF/μm. There are many materials with lower relative dielectric constants but few of them can be suitably integrated into a manufacturing process. Development efforts have focused primarily on the following classes of materials:",0

The coastal wolves of southeast Alaska inhabit the area that includes the Alexander Archipelago, its islands, and a narrow strip of rugged coastline that is biologically isolated from the rest of North America by the Coast Mountains. The Tongass National Forest comprises about 80% of the region. In 1993, a petition to list the Alexander Archipelago wolf as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act was lodged with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

In 2011, a second petition to list the species as either threatened or endangered was filed with the Fish and Wildlife Service. It referenced scientific studies and other information that had arisen over the intervening 14 years. In March 2014, in response to the petition, the agency made a positive initial finding that listing the species as threatened or endangered ""may be warranted"" and that it will prepare a formal status review.",0

"Mission College (Mission or MC)  is a public community college in Santa Clara, California.  It is part of the West Valley–Mission Community College District. The land the college is on was bought between 1966 and 1967. Mission College opened for its first year in 1975. In 1979 it had grown to ""3,500 students, 8 administrators, and 73 instructors"". History
The Mission College Interim Campus was housed on the site of the vacant Jefferson Middle School at the corner  of Monroe Street and Lawrence Express in Santa Clara, California in early September, 1975. From this humble beginning, three members originally appointed for full-time duty—Teri Chiang (Mathematics), Don Joslen (Fine Arts), and Son Le (Philosophy)) worked  with Administrator Burt Hermosillo with the support of several part-time faculty volunteers from West Valley College to offer morning and evening classes. By summer, 1976, the Governing Board had appointed Warren Sorenson as founding president. Mission College's first Commencement took place in June, 1977 with the President of Santa Clara University as Commencement Speaker. Notably, among a handful of graduates for Mission College Class '77 was Eddie Sousa who was later elected Mayor of Santa Clara. The birth of Mission College seemed uneventful; its full development was not, however. Reported disputes over noise levels at West Valley College with its Saratoga residents helped changed the membership of the long-serving Governing Board, leading in upper management changes at both West Valley and Mission Colleges soon after the new Mission College campus was completed in 1979. Even though the departure of its founding president was unexpected, among many legacies of his was Mission College's commitment students as individual learners: individualized self-paced learning, decades before the advent of the digital revolution and cyber learning.",0

It was published by the Quaid-i-Azam Academy in 1987. A major focus of the book are his political aspirations and how his failing health affected them. The Daily Times summarized it as ""...he was aware of the peril his failing health posed, thus wanted to do whatever he could to build the new country whose existence was precarious owing to lack of resources and enormous challenges on the economic and political fronts.""

"Pierre Loti (; pseudonym of Louis Marie-Julien Viaud ; 14 January 1850 – 10 June 1923) was a French naval officer and novelist, known for his exotic novels and short stories. Biography
Born to a Protestant family, Loti's education began in his birthplace, Rochefort, Charente-Maritime. At age 17 he entered the naval school in Brest and studied at Le Borda.  He gradually rose in his profession, attaining the rank of captain in 1906.  In January 1910 he went on the reserve list. He was in the habit of claiming that he never read books, saying to the Académie française on the day of his introduction (7 April 1892), ""Loti ne sait pas lire"" (""Loti doesn't know how to read""), but testimony from friends proves otherwise, as does his library, much of which is preserved in his house in Rochefort.  In 1876 fellow naval officers persuaded him to turn into a novel passages in his diary dealing with some curious experiences in Istanbul.  The result was the anonymously published Aziyadé (1879), part romance, part autobiography, like the work of his admirer, Marcel Proust, after him.",0

"Philippine jade artifacts, made from white and green nephrite and dating as far back as 2000–1500 BC, have been discovered at a number of archeological excavations in the Philippines since the 1930s. The artifacts have been both tools like chisels, and ornaments such as lingling-o earrings, bracelets and beads. The green nephrite has been traced to a deposit near the modern Hualien City in eastern Taiwan. The source of the white nephrite is unknown. The jade was worked in the Philippines, especially in Batanes, Luzon, and Palawan. Some was also processed in Vietnam, while the peoples of Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia also participated in one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world.

"Russell Thomas Francis Skinner (1908–1998) was a British architect and the longest-serving member of Tecton, the architectural practice founded by Berthold Lubetkin in 1932 that pioneered the Modern Movement in Britain. As the historian John Allan recalls, ‘Skinner was Lubetkin's closest colleague, who shared and supported his charismatic partner's belief in modern architecture as an instrument of social progress’.
  
Politically and architecturally radical, Skinner trained at the Architectural Association from 1927 but reacted strongly against ‘traditionalist teaching’ in favour of the progressive European Modernism embodied by Lubetkin. ‘His first building, a prize-winning reinforced concrete house for the Modern Homes Exhibition at Gidea Park, was completed in 1934 when he was only 26’ (Allen). This house is still extant and in close to original condition. (64 Heath Drive Gidea Park) Restored extensively under the supervision of English Heritage, it is listed Grade 2. Skinner was active in the Communist Party, the Architects & Technicians Organisation, and other leftist groups that campaigned for better housing conditions and the unionisation of building workers. After first-hand observation of bomb damage in the Spanish Civil War he designed and promoted deep air-raid shelters. Skinner took Lubetkin’s projects, for the progressive London Borough of Finsbury, starting with Finsbury Health Centre (1938), continuing after World War II, with the Spa Green Estate, Priory Green and Bevin Court (Holford Square), for which he designed the signage as well as supervising the project. John Allen records that Skinner ‘declined an invitation from Le Corbusier to join him at Chandigarh in 1950 but continued with major housing developments in Bethnal Green, Hackney and Southwark in the reformed firm of Skinner, Bailey & Lubetkin’. Many of his designs for London public housing are preserved in the British Architectural Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects.",0

"AuTx is a terpolyaramide fibre that was developed during 2005 to 2012 by Alchemie Group. It is based on Russian aramid fibres. AuTx-FR is a fire resistant fibre with high thermal stability and high LOI and strength at elevated temperatures, with minimal thermal degradation. The process of forming AuTx-FR fibres allows the LOI to be varied between 40-70 with a trade-off for lesser strength the higher the LOI number is. The history of AuTx started in 1976 with the creation of the first Russian para-aramid fibres under the name SVM (Super High modulus Fibre). The process of fibre forming was principally different from those used while forming of Kevlar and Twaron aramid fibres. The SVM fibre had high strength (190-220 cN/tex), high modulus (75-100 GPa) and high elongation at break (3,0-4,0%). This fibre was used in high-strength lightweight composites and as a fabric was used in the creation of first flexible Russian bullet-proof vests.",0

"White is the lightest color and is achromatic (having no hue). It is the color of snow, chalk, and milk, and is the opposite of black. White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light.  White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue, and green light. The color white can be given with white pigments, especially titanium dioxide. Symbolic meaning
In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.",0
"Typhoon Yancy, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Tasing, was one of the costliest and most intense tropical cyclones to strike Japan on record. Yancy was the sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season and sixth tropical cyclone overall to impact Japan that year. Developing out of an area of disturbed weather in the open northwest Pacific on August 29, 1993, the precursor to Yancy tracked westward and quickly intensified to reach tropical storm strength on August 30. Just two days later, the tropical storm reached typhoon intensity as it recurved towards the northeast. A period of rapid intensification followed, allowing Yancy to quickly reach super typhoon intensity. The strong tropical cyclone reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). The following day Yancy made its first landfall on Iōjima at nearly the same strength; over the course of the day the typhoon would make three subsequent landfalls on Japanese islands. Land interaction forced the tropical cyclone to weaken, and after its final landfall on Hiroshima Prefecture, Yancy weakened below typhoon intensity. After emerging into the Sea of Japan, Yancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone; these remnants persisted as they meandered in the sea before dissipating completely on September 7.

He was born in the parish of Llangyfelach, Swansea, Wales, the eldest son of Lewis Weston Dillwyn and Mary Dillwyn, née Adams, the natural daughter of Col. John Llewelyn of Penllergaer and Ynysygerwn. His sister, Mary Dillwyn (1816–1906), is remembered as the earliest female photographer in Wales. Upon coming of age he inherited his maternal grandfather John Llewelyn's estates of Penllergaer and Ynysygerwn, near Swansea, and assumed the additional surname of Llewelyn. Educated privately, he met through his father (a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Linnean Society, and at one time a member of Parliament) many of the eminent men of his time. These included Sir David Brewster, Michael Faraday and Charles Wheatstone. His father Lewis Weston Dillwyn had been sent to Swansea in 1803 by Lewis' father William to take over the management of the Cambrian Pottery. 
 
In 1833 he married Emma Thomasina Talbot, daughter of Thomas Mansel Talbot and Lady Mary Lucy, née Fox Strangways, the younger daughter of the Earl & Countess of Ilchester. Thomas was related to William Davenport Talbot and Mary was the sister of Elisabeth Talbot, the parents of William Henry Fox Talbot.

"A whodunit or whodunnit (a colloquial elision of ""Who [has] done it?"") is a complex plot-driven variety of detective fiction in which the puzzle regarding who committed the crime is the main focus. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues to the case, from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric, amateur, or semi-professional detective. Concept 
A whodunit follows the paradigm of the classical detective story in the sense that it presents crime as a puzzle to be solved through a chain of questions that the detective poses. In a whodunit, however, the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. This engages the readers so that they strive to compete with or outguess the expert investigator.",0

"Sab Grey (real name: Frederick Prasunitz) is the founder of Iron Cross, one of the United States' first skinhead hardcore/Oi! bands.
As a teenager, he began to attend hardcore punk concerts in Washington DC, where he met Ian Mackaye, Henry Rollins, and others in the burgeoning Washington, DC hardcore subculture. In 1980, he founded Iron Cross.  The band's name, as well as the skinhead look favored by its members, led to accusations of fascism, which Grey has always denied. Iron Cross released a handful of EPs, later released together as the album Live For Now, on GMM records (GMM174.)  Their song ""Crucified"" became a hardcore classic after being covered by Agnostic Front.  Other bands who have covered their songs include the Dropkick Murphys (You're A Rebel) and English Oi! band The Business (Crucified.)

"John Frederick Peto (May 21, 1854 – November 23, 1907) was an American trompe-l'œil (""fool the eye"") painter who was long forgotten until his paintings were rediscovered along with those of fellow trompe-l'œil artist William Harnett. Career
Although Peto and the slightly older Harnett knew each other and painted similar subjects, their careers followed different paths. Peto was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts at the same time as Harnett. Until he was in his mid-thirties, he submitted paintings regularly to the annual exhibitions at the Philadelphia Academy. In 1889, he moved to the resort town of Island Heights, New Jersey, where he worked in obscurity for the rest of his life. He and his wife took in seasonal boarders, he found work playing cornet at the town's camp revival meetings, and he supplemented his income by selling his paintings to tourists. He never had a gallery exhibition in his lifetime. Harnett, on the other hand, achieved success and had considerable influence on other artists painting in the trompe-l'œil genre, but even his paintings were given the snub by critics as mere novelty and trickery.",0

"Mineral processing and extraction of metals are very energy-intensive processes, which are not exempted of producing large volumes of solid residues and wastewater, which also require energy to be further treated and disposed. Moreover, as the demand for metals increases, the metallurgical industry must rely on sources of materials with lower metal contents both from a primary (e.g., mineral ores) and/or secondary (e.g., slags, tailings, municipal waste) raw materials. Consequently, mining activities and waste recycling must evolve towards the development of more selective, efficient and environmentally friendly mineral and metal processing routes. Mineral processing operations are needed firstly to concentrate the mineral phases of interest and reject the unwanted material physical or chemically associated to a defined raw material. The process, however, demand about 30 GJ/tonne of metal, which accounts about 29% of the total energy spent on mining in the USA. Meanwhile, pyrometallurgy is a significant producer of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful flue dust. Hydrometallurgy entails the consumption of large volumes of lixiviants such as H2SO4, HCl, KCN, NaCN which have poor selectivity. Moreover, despite the environmental concern and the use restriction imposed by some countries, cyanidation is still considered the prime process technology to recover gold from ores. Mercury is also used by artisanal miners in less economically developed countries to concentrate gold and silver from minerals, despite its obvious toxicity. Bio-hydro-metallurgy make use of living organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, and although this method demands only the input of O2 and CO2 from the atmosphere, it requires low solid-to-liquid ratios and long contact times, which significantly reduces space-time yields.",0
"An intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) is a protein that lacks a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure, typically in the absence of its macromolecular interaction partners, such as other proteins or RNA. IDPs range from fully unstructured to partially structured and include random coil, molten globule-like aggregates, or flexible linkers in large multi-domain proteins. They are sometimes considered as a separate class of proteins along with globular, fibrous and membrane proteins. The discovery of IDPs has disproved the idea that three-dimensional structures of proteins must be fixed to accomplish their biological functions. The dogma of rigid protein structure has been abandoned due to the increasing evidence of dynamics being necessary for the protein machines. Despite their lack of stable structure, IDPs are a very large and functionally important class of proteins. Many IDPs can adopt a fixed three-dimensional structure after binding to other macromolecules. Overall, IDPs are different from structured proteins in many ways and tend to have distinctive function, structure, sequence, interactions, evolution and regulation.",0

"Lego Super Mario is a Lego theme based on the platform game series Super Mario. It is licensed from Nintendo. The theme was first introduced in 2020. Overview
 The Lego Super Mario theme was the result of the collaboration between The Lego Group and Nintendo for the 35th anniversary of the 1985 game Super Mario Bros. The sets are essentially a mix between a Lego set and a video game, where people can build real life versions of 2D Super Mario levels, including grasslands, deserts and Bowser's Castle. The key part of the theme is the interactive Super Mario figurine. Unlike traditional Lego figurines, the Mario figure is large and electronic, with the eyes, mouth and chest use an LED display. Another key feature of the figurine is the scanner on the bottom of the Mario figurine, and Bluetooth connectivity. The scanner uses colors or machine-readable codes to operate. The scanner can change the LED display to affect the expressions or actions of Mario. For example, if the scanner scans the color red, Mario will detect it as lava and pretends to ""lose a life"". Codes can be placed on enemies, ? Blocks, power-ups, Warp Pipes and flag poles to display action on the chest display, like coins when Mario defeats an enemy. All of these produce sound effects, attributing the Super Mario franchise. Finally, the Mario figurine utilises Bluetooth to connect to the official app. The app can also be used for challenges, as a camera and as a digital instruction booklet, and to update the firmware on the Mario figurine. The theme was sold with 11 sets of Mario levels, 4 costume packs which reference previous Mario power ups and a blind-bag collection featuring 10 reoccurring Mario enemies.",0
"In Advaita Vedanta and Jnana Yoga Nididhyasana (Sanskrit: निदिध्यासन) is profound and repeated meditation on the mahavakyas, great Upanishadic statements such as ""That art Thou"", to realize the identity of Atman and Brahman. It is the fourth step in the training of a sisya (disciple), consisting of preparatory practices, listening to the teachings as contained in the sruti, reflection on the teachings, and nididhyasana. Four stages of practice
Nididhyasana is the final step in the correct understanding of the meaning of the Mahavakyas. Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of four stages:
 Samanyasa or Sampattis, the ""fourfold discipline"" (sādhana-chatustaya), cultivating the following four qualities:
  (नित्यानित्य वस्तु विवेकम्) — The ability (viveka) to correctly discriminate between the eternal (nitya) substance (Brahman) and the substance that is transitory existence (anitya).
  (इहाऽमुत्रार्थ फल भोगविरागम्) — The renunciation (virāga) of enjoyments of objects (artha phala bhoga) in this world (iha) and the other worlds (amutra) like heaven etc.
  (शमादि षट्क सम्पत्ति) — the sixfold qualities,
 Śama (control of the ).
 Dama (the control of external sense organs).
 Uparati (the cessation of these external organs so restrained, from the pursuit of objects other than that, or it may mean the abandonment of the prescribed works according to scriptural injunctions).
 Titikṣa (the tolerating of ).
 Śraddhā (the faith in Guru and Vedas).
Samādhāna (the concentrating of the mind on God and Guru).
  (मुमुक्षुत्वम्) — The firm conviction that the nature of the world is misery and the intense longing for moksha (release from the cycle of births and deaths).
 Sravana, listening to the teachings of the sages on the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta, and studying the Vedantic texts, such as the Brahma Sutras. In this stage the student learns about the reality of Brahman and the identity of atman;
 Manana, the stage of reflection on the teachings;
 Nididhyāsana, the stage of meditation on the truth ""that art Thou"".",0

"Terceira  is a volcanic island in the Azores archipelago, located about halfway between the mainland of Portugal and the island of São Miguel. The island is home to a population of about 1,500 people.

The name Terceira is of uncertain origin. One theory suggests that it may be derived from the Latin tertius meaning ""third"", while another suggests that it may come from the Arabic word terekh meaning ""island"".

The island was first inhabited in the 6th century BC by the Guanches, an indigenous people who were later replaced by the Portuguese in the early 12th century AD. Terceira remained under Portuguese rule until the early 18th century, when it was ceded to Spain as part of the Treaty of Paris following the War of Spanish Succession. In 1809, following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, British forces occupied Terceira and declared it part of the United Kingdom. Under British rule, Terceira experienced a rapid economic expansion, with new settlements being established on the island and its agricultural sector becoming increasingly mechanized. The island became part of Portugal in 1881 following its independence from Britain, and during World War II it was used as a base by Allied forces operating in Europe. In 2002, Terceira was designated an Autonomous Region of Portugal.",1

"The Ill-Matched Lovers is  an oil painting by the early Netherlandish master Quentin Matsys, usually dated between 1520 and 1525. This painting depicts the trope that old age can make one foolish. Matsys depicts this theme by showing an older man besotted by a younger, beautiful woman. He gazes at her adoringly, not noticing that with the aid of an accomplice, she is stealing his purse. The face of the old man was influenced by a drawing done by Leonardo da Vinci, demonstrating Matsys’ skill in combining Northern European themes with Italian elements. Bibliography

"The Rikugun Ki-93 was a prototype Japanese twin-engined fighter aircraft of the Second World War. Designed by the Army Aerotechnical Research Institute, to be a heavy fighter armed with large calibre cannon to serve in the anti-shipping or bomber destroyer roles, only one example of the Ki-93 was completed; this was damaged on its maiden flight, and destroyed by American bombing before it could be flown again. Development and design
In mid 1941, a team was set up at the Japanese Army Aerotechnical Research Institute (or Rikugun Kokugijutsu Kenkyujo, known by the abbreviation Giken) to study advanced military aircraft. The team drew up preliminary designs for a twin-engined heavy fighter for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, to be powered by two Mitsubishi Ha-211 radial engines and estimated to reach a speed of 680 km/h (422 mph). In July 1942, the design, along with some of the team from Giken, was passed to the First Army Air Arsenal (Dai-Ichi Rikugun Kokusho or Kosho) at Tachikawa for further development. Here, the design was refined, with more powerful Mitsubishi Ha-214 radials substituted and a heavy cannon armament added.",0

"The Abbeville massacre (French: Massacre d'Abbeville, Dutch: Bloedbad van Abbeville) took place during World War II on 20 May 1940 in the city of Abbeville, France. Administrative detainees
During the German invasion, the Belgian authorities had arrested a number of suspects (""enemy Belgians and enemy foreigners"") between 10 and 15 May on the orders of the auditor general Walter Ganshof van der Meersch. ""It is clear that the arrests were very irresponsible and arbitrary. They just picked up some people: out of revenge, out of jealousy, because of their political beliefs, their Jewish origin or because of their foreign nationality,"" wrote survivor Gaby Warris. These administrative internees were imprisoned in 't Pandreitje, the former prison of Bruges. Among them were Joris Van Severen, Léon Degrelle and other notables. Despite unsuccessful attempts by befriended members of parliament to free Van Severen (as they had VNV leader Staf Declercq), he was deported to France on 15 May 1940 with Degrelle and 77 others. Unlike the other suspects who were taken away in so-called ""ghost trains"", this mixed group (handcuffed in pairs) was driven in three buses via Ostend to Dunkirk, where Degrelle was removed from the group. In the study Dossier Abbeville, the backgrounds of all 'suspicious' persons were extensively discussed. The 21 Belgians also included the Rexist René Wéry, Verdinaso member Jan Rijckoort (the right-hand man of Van Severen) and VNV member Maurits Van Gijsegem. The group also included 18 Jews, 14 German citizens, four Italians (Ferrucio Bellumat, Luigi Lazarelli, Guiseppe Mantella, and Mirko Taccardi), two Dutchmen (Willem van de Loo and Johannes van der Plas), Canadian ice hockey coach Bobby Bell, a number of Belgian communists (Louis Caestecker and Lucien Monami, among others), and two Belgians (Jean-Henri De Bruyn and Hector Vanderkelen) who actually did work for the German Abwehr.",0

"LightGBM, short for Light Gradient Boosting Machine, is a free and open source distributed gradient boosting framework for machine learning originally developed by Microsoft. It is based on decision tree algorithms and used for ranking, classification and other machine learning tasks. The development focus is on performance and scalability. Overview
The LightGBM framework supports different algorithms including GBT, GBDT, GBRT, GBM, MART and RF. LightGBM has many of XGBoost's advantages, including sparse optimization, parallel training, multiple loss functions, regularization, bagging, and early stopping. A major difference between the two lies in the construction of trees. LightGBM does not grow a tree level-wise — row by row — as most other implementations do. Instead it grows trees leaf-wise. It chooses the leaf it believes will yield the largest decrease in loss. Besides, LightGBM does not use the widely-used sorted-based decision tree learning algorithm, which searches the best split point on sorted feature values, as XGBoost or other implementations do. Instead, LightGBM implements a highly optimized histogram-based decision tree learning algorithm, which yields great advantages on both efficiency and memory consumption.  The LightGBM algorithm utilizes two novel techniques called Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) which allow the algorithm to run faster while maintaining a high level of accuracy.",0

"In the United States, the National Biodefense Strategy is a biosecurity strategy that the federal government was directed to adopt by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The act—the periodic National Defense Authorization Act, the authorization bill for national security—required the secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture to coordinate to produce a comprehensive strategy for countering biological warfare threats and other biological threats. The Donald Trump administration announced the National Biodefense Strategy of 2018 the following year. Later, the Donald Trump administration announced they would siphon funds from medical programs to supplement fundings for the strategy. When questioned about this, it was reported that the Obama administration provided the plans for the strategy. History and background
Prior to the 2018 congressional directive, previous U.S. government biodefense strategies existed, including the George W. Bush administration's 2004 Homeland Security Presidential Directive-10 (""Biodefense for the 21st Century""), which was one of many laws and executive actions enacted following the 2001 anthrax attacks. The push for increased federal funding in biodefense began during Bush's term in office. For example, in 2006, Bush, in his annual budget request, asked for a total of $5.1 billion for civilian biodefense. This number was a decrease of $2.5 billion from the previous year's budget. The drop was primarily attributed to the absence of Project BioShield money in 2006; the money for that year was already allocated the previous year. Overall, the 2006 request contained incremental increases for all agencies involved in biodefense. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-10's primary focus was on preventing, detecting, and responding to potential intentional attacks using biological weapons, and set forth the role of the nascent U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other institutions.",0

"Ice–albedo feedback is a positive feedback climate process where a change in the area of ice caps, glaciers, and sea ice alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet. Ice is very reflective, therefore some of the solar energy is reflected back to space. Ice–albedo feedback plays an important role in global climate change. For instance, at higher latitudes, warmer temperatures melt the ice sheets. However, if warm temperatures decrease the ice cover and the area is replaced by water or land, the albedo would decrease. This increases the amount of solar energy absorbed, leading to more warming. The effect has mostly been discussed in terms of the recent trend of declining Arctic sea ice. The change in albedo acts to reinforce the initial alteration in ice area leading to more warming. Warming tends to decrease ice cover and hence decrease the albedo, increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed and leading to more warming. In the geologically recent past, the ice–albedo positive feedback has played a major role in the advances and retreats of the Pleistocene (~2.6 Ma to ~10 ka ago) ice sheets.  Inversely, cooler temperatures increase ice, which increases albedo, leading to more cooling. Evidence 
Snow– and ice–albedo feedback tend to amplify regional warming due to anthropogenic climate change. Due to this amplification, the cryosphere is sometimes called the ""natural thermometer"" of Earth because changes in each of its components have long lasting effects on the systems (biological, physical and social) of Earth. Internal feedback processes may also potentially occur. As land ice melts and causes eustatic sea level rise, it can also potentially induce earthquakes as a result of post-glacial rebound, which further disrupts glaciers and ice shelves. If sea-ice retreats in the Arctic, the albedo of the sea will be darker which results in more warming. Similarly, if the Greenland or Antarctic land ice retreats, the darker underlying land is exposed and more solar radiation is absorbed.",0

"New Salem is a town in Franklin County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 983 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. History 
New Salem was first settled in 1737 and was officially incorporated in 1753, named for the settlers from Salem that founded the town.  New Salem benefited greatly by the building of the Quabbin Reservoir - though mostly geographically.  Prior to its building, New Salem, which has always been the southeast corner of Franklin County, did not extend much further south than the village of Cooleyville, now along U.S. Route 202.  However, with the forming of the reservoir, the town received all lands above the water line between the two forks of the reservoir, as it was the only land connection to the peninsula.  With its southern borders now following former branches of the Swift River, New Salem now includes most of the former town of Prescott (except for a small corner east of the Middle Branch of the Swift River, which is now in Petersham), and parts of Greenwich and Enfield.

"Christ Crucified  is a 1780 oil-on-canvas painting of the crucifixion of Jesus by Spanish Romantic painter Francisco de Goya. He presented it to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando as his reception piece as an academic painter. It now forms part of the permanent collection of the Prado Museum in Madrid. Analysis 
The painting is neoclassical in style, though rooted in traditional Spanish iconography of the subject and related to the treatment of the same topic by Velázquez (even borrowing its dark black background with no landscape) and Anton Raphael Mengs (borrowing his presentation of the right leg pushed forwards). Goya conforms to the Spanish Baroque iconographic rules for portraying the Crucifixion as laid down by Francisco Pacheco – the black background, four rather than three nails, supported feet and a trilingual inscription at the top of the cross beginning IESUS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM. By obeying these rules Goya diminished the emphasis on devotional features such as drama and the presence of blood in order to concentrate attention on the painting's soft modelling, since his intention was to please the academicians then dominated by Mengs' neoclassicism.",0
"Soccer's Hard Men is a 1992 football video by Video Vision, presented by then-footballer and current actor Vinnie Jones.

Publicity for the video described it as ""the toughest football video in history"". This and similar claims led to accusations that the video glorified foul play. Jones' commentary, in which he described tricks used by ""hard man"" players to intimidate opponents, caused particular controversy. The clubs of the players involved in the production were quick to distance themselves from the contents. Sam Hammam, chairman of Wimbledon, whose ""Crazy Gang"" featured heavily in the video, said the production was ""nothing to do with Wimbledon"", describing Jones (who played for Wimbledon) as ""a mosquito brain"", and banning the sale of the video in the club shop. The Football Association formally charged Jones with bringing the game into disrepute on 30 September 1992, with the video still yet to be released. Following a hearing on 17 November, Jones was fined a record £20,000, surpassing a fine of £8,500 issued to Paul McGrath three years earlier.

"In computer science, a Simple LR or SLR parser is a type of LR parser with small parse tables and a relatively simple parser generator algorithm.  As with other types of LR(1) parser, an SLR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, without guesswork or backtracking.  The parser is mechanically generated from a formal grammar for the language. SLR and the more-general methods LALR parser and Canonical LR parser have identical methods and similar tables at parse time; they differ only in the mathematical grammar analysis algorithms used by the parser generator tool.  SLR and LALR generators create tables of identical size and identical parser states.  SLR generators accept fewer grammars than do LALR generators like yacc and Bison.  Many computer languages don't readily fit the restrictions of SLR, as is.  Bending the language's natural grammar into SLR grammar form requires more compromises and grammar hackery. So LALR generators have become much more widely used than SLR generators, despite being somewhat more complicated tools.  SLR methods remain a useful learning step in college classes on compiler theory.",0

"Andreas Peter Bernstorff (28 August 173521 June 1797), also known as Andreas Peter Graf von Bernstorff, was a Danish diplomat and Foreign Minister. He was a guardian of civil and political liberty. Background and early career
Bernstorff was born in Hanover as a nephew of the statesman Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff (1712-72), whose position probably introduced him to Danish politics. His uncle induced him to study in the German and Swiss universities and travel for some years in Italy, France, England and Holland, to prepare himself for a statesman’s career. During these years he made the acquaintance of the poets Gellert and Jacobi, the writer Jean-Jacques Barthélemy, the duc de Choiseul, and Gottfried Achenwall, the statistician. After his European tour, he joined the Danish state service, first as a courtier and then from 1760 as a state official, both in foreign political and financial matters. His career was slow but steady. During the 1760s, he placed himself as an able but not outstanding official closely connected to his uncle. In the Struensee years from 1770–71, he was dismissed, but soon he was recalled by the new regime of Ove Høegh-Guldberg. He worked at first in the financial and economical departments, and took a special interest in agriculture. The improvements he introduced in the tenures of his peasantry anticipated in some respects the agricultural reforms of the next generation.",0

"Interkosmos is a 2006 film directed by Jim Finn. Plot summary
This film is a false documentary about a fictional, top-secret Soviet Interkosmos space mission based in East Germany. Two ships are sent out to set up both an industrial colony on Saturn's moon Titan and a recreational colony on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. The film covers the background of the mission, as well as several radio conversations between the leaders of the two separate colonizing missions, the female Seagull and the male Falcon, who are implied to be in a romantic relationship.

Holy Rosary, a mission church, is a brick building on Hardin's Creek close to the Beech Fork River.  Rev. Victor Francis O'Daniel O.P.M. mentions in his book ""A Light Of The Church In Kentucky"" (copyright 1932) on page 140 that a station ""... was possibly that of Wilfred Fields, where now stands Holy Rosary Church, Manton (or Blincoe)"". This village was once known as Blincoe as is identified as such in the 1896 Kentucky Gazetteer. Richard Blincoe was a resident at that time. It was known as Blincoe until (at least) the mid-1900s, as it appears on as such on the 1949 official Kentucky highway map for Washington County. Derivation of the name of this town has been attributed to the surnames of William Frederick Mandt and his wife, Mary Ann Harrington; however, the Kentucky town and U.S.Post Office named in their honor was Manton, Floyd County, Kentucky, ZIP Code (now inactive) 41648.  The Mandt Family of Manton, Floyd County, were generous supporters of Catholic religious and educational interests in the region of Nelson and Washington Counties in the early-to-mid-Twentieth Century, and it has been suggested that Blincoe was redesignated as ""Manton"" in recognition of their support.  However, Mr. and Mrs. Mandt were married in 1894, and any appearance of the name ""Manton"" prior to that time is not attributable to their family.",0

"Deparia acrostichoides, commonly called silvery glade fern or silvery spleenwort, is a perennial species of fern. Its range include much of the eastern United States and Canada, from Ontario to Nova Scotia, and Georgia to Louisiana and eastern Asia in China, Russia, Japan and Korea. The name silvery comes from the fact that the indusia on the underside of the leaf have a silver color when the sori are close to ripening. Description
Silvery spleenwort has pinnately divided yellowish green leaves arising from a stout, green, slightly brown hairy and scaly stem.  The stem is typically grooved on the upper side, much shorter than the leaf blade and darker colored near its base, being dark red or brown, as the stem reaches the leaflets it becomes a pale green color. The leaves are broadest in the middle with a long pointed tip and tapering base with the lowest pair of leaflets generally pointing downward. The tapering and downward pointed bottom leaves are a diagnostic characteristic for helping to distinguish this fern from similar ferns.",0

"Garden leave (also known as Gardening leave) is the practice whereby an employee leaving a job—having resigned or otherwise had their employment terminated—is instructed to stay away from work during the notice period, while still remaining on the payroll. The term is in common use in banking and other financial employment in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. This practice is often used to prevent an employee from taking with them up-to-date (and perhaps sensitive) information when they leave their current employer, especially when they are very likely leaving to join a competitor. In jurisdictions where employee non-compete clauses are legal, the practice is used to maintain the effectiveness of such clauses. This is also sometimes used when an employee position is no longer needed during the notice period. Sometimes, the practice is used to avoid lackadaisical work or sabotage by an uninterested or disaffected employee, or when an employer wishes to imply that is the case. The term can also refer to the case of an employee sent home pending disciplinary proceeding, when they are between projects, or when, as a result of publicity, their presence at work is considered counter-productive. It has also been used in British football.",0

"Kozachok  or Kazachok  is a traditional Ukrainian and Russian folk dance originating with the Cossacks in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was performed throughout contemporary Ukraine and also in the noble courts of Europe. It is a fast, linear, couple-dance in  time, typically in a constantly increasing tempo and of an improvisatory character, typically in a minor key in Ukraine, and in a major key in Russia. The woman leads and the man follows, imitating her figures – she signals movement changes by hand clapping. In the 17th century, kozachok became fashionable in court music in Europe. The term ""kozachok"" can be traced back to the Vertep, the 16th to 19th-century Ukrainian itinerant puppet theatre. Vertep plays consisted of two parts, the first dramatizing the birth of Christ, and the second with a secular plot, often a morality tale.  In Russia there exist different versions of the kozachok dance the Kuban Kazachok (Krasnodar region of southern Russia), and Terek Kazachok (northern Caucasus region). Historically these regions had an important Ukrainian population which was significantly reduced in the Soviet era. ",0

"Negotiated rulemaking is a process in American administrative law, used by federal agencies, in which representatives from a government agency and affected interest groups negotiate the terms of a proposed administrative rule. The agency publishes the proposed rule in the Federal Register and then follows the usual rulemaking procedure of soliciting public comments, which are evaluated for inclusion in the final rule. Origins
Negotiated rulemaking, sometimes abbreviated as ""reg neg,"" emerged most prominently in the early 1980s because of a concern that traditional rulemaking procedures had become too adversarial. John Dunlop, Secretary of Labor under President Gerald Ford, first introduced the idea of formally engaging affected interests in negotiations over federal regulations in the 1970s. In 1982 Phillip Harter, an administrative law expert, developed the idea of reg neg further in a report to the Administrative Conference of the United States and then a law review article, proposing negotiation as a means of alleviating the ""malaise"" that hindered the existing federal rulemaking process. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Transportation were the first agencies to experiment with negotiated rulemaking. Other agencies were more reluctant to try it, out of concern about its legality. Those questions were answered when the United States Congress enacted the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 (Reg Neg Act), ""to encourage agencies to use negotiated rulemaking when it enhances the informal rulemaking process."" The Reg Neg Act was reauthorized in 1996 and is now incorporated into the Administrative Procedure Act, at 5 U.S.C. §§ 561-570.
A believer in the effectiveness of reg neg, President Clinton encouraged agencies to use the approach in Executive Order #12866 and in a subsequent Presidential Memorandum.",0

"Muziris (, Malayalam: Muchiri possibly identical with medieval Muyirikode) was an ancient harbour and urban centre on the Malabar Coast that dates from at least the 1st century BC. Situated around present day Kodungallur, the exact location of Muziris is unknown to historians and archaeologists but recent excavations at Pattanam suggest Pattanam may be Muziris. Muziris found mention in the bardic Tamil poems and a number of classical sources. Muziris was a key to the interactions between South India and Persia, the Middle East, North Africa, and the (Greek and Roman) Mediterranean region. The important known commodities exported from Muziris were spices (such as black pepper and malabathron), semi-precious stones (such as beryl), pearls, diamonds, sapphires, ivory, Chinese silk, Gangetic spikenard and tortoise shells. The Roman navigators brought gold coins, peridots, thin clothing, figured linens, multicoloured textiles, sulfide of antimony, copper, tin, lead, coral, raw glass, wine, realgar and orpiment.  The locations of unearthed coin-hoards suggest an inland trade link from Muziris via the Palghat Gap and along the Kaveri Valley to the east coast of India. Though the Roman trade declined from the 5th century AD, the former Muziris attracted the attention of other nationalities, particularly the Persians, the Chinese and the Arabs, presumably until the devastating floods of Periyar in the 14th century.",0

"Comet vintages are years during which an astronomical event, involving generally a ""Great Comet"", occurs prior to harvest. Throughout the history of wine, winemakers have attributed successful vintages and ideal weather conditions to the unexplained effects caused by the comets. Some of the most heralded vintages in the last couple of centuries—such as the 1811, 1826, 1839, 1845, 1852, 1858, 1861, 1985, and 1989 vintages—have coincided with a notable appearance of a comet. There is no scientific basis for any effect of comets on viticulture, but the term nevertheless remains in use. The term ""comet wine"" is sometimes used in the wine world to describe a wine of exceptional quality in reference to the high reputation that comet vintages have. The 1811 comet vintage, coinciding with the appearance of the Great Comet of 1811, is perhaps the most famous. The 1811 Château d'Yquem has exhibited what wine experts like Robert Parker have described as exceptional longevity with Parker scoring the wine a perfect 100 points when tasted in 1996. The 1811 vintage of Veuve Clicquot is theorized to have been the first truly ""modern"" Champagne due to the advancements in the méthode champenoise which Veuve Clicquot pioneered through the technique of remuage.",0

"Kilburn Priory was a small monastic community of nuns established around 1130–1134 three miles north-west of the City of London, where Watling Street (now Kilburn High Road) met the stream now known as the Westbourne, but variously known as Cuneburna, Keneburna, Keeleburne, Coldburne, or Caleburn, meaning either the royal or cow's stream. The priory gave its name to the area now known as Kilburn, and the local streets Priory Road, Kilburn Priory, Priory Terrace, and Abbey Road. The site was used until 1130 as a hermitage by Godwyn, a recluse, who subsequently gave the property to the conventual church of St. Peter, Westminster. The priory was established with the consent of Gilbert Universalis, bishop of London, before his death in August 1134. Though it was originally subordinate to Westminster Abbey, whose monks followed the Benedictine rule, by 1377 it was described as being an order of Augustinian canonesses. It was once believed that the Ancrene Riwle was written for the first three nuns of Kilburn, but this is now thought unlikely.",0

Fremantle Long Jetty was constructed in 1873 to replace the smaller South Jetty which had become too small for the large amounts of vessels entering the colony in Western Australia. The jetty lies in Bather's Bay which has been an occupation site since the Swan River Colony was established in 1829. It was a centre of trade and communications that served Fremantle and Perth until Fremantle Harbour was opened. An increased amount of shipping made it necessary to improve the harbouring facilities by the late 1860s.  Long Jetty was built as a less expensive alternative to building a harbour at the mouth of the Swan River due to a lack of funds and technological shortcomings. In July 1984 the Maritime Archaeology Department of the Western Australian Museum was notified of plans to construct a marina for the 1987 America's Cup that would be close to the remains of the Long Jetty. This prompted an archaeological excavation to ascertain the importance of the site.,0

"Radiation pressure is the mechanical pressure exerted upon any surface due to the exchange of momentum between the object and the electromagnetic field. This includes the momentum of light or electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength that is absorbed, reflected, or otherwise emitted (e.g. black-body radiation) by matter on any scale (from macroscopic objects to dust particles to gas molecules). The associated force is called the radiation pressure force, or sometimes just the force of light. The forces generated by radiation pressure are generally too small to be noticed under everyday circumstances; however, they are important in some physical processes and technologies. This particularly includes objects in outer space, where it is usually the main force acting on objects besides gravity, and where the net effect of a tiny force may have a large cumulative effect over long periods of time. For example, had the effects of the Sun's radiation pressure on the spacecraft of the Viking program been ignored, the spacecraft would have missed Mars' orbit by about . Radiation pressure from starlight is crucial in a number of astrophysical processes as well. The significance of radiation pressure increases rapidly at extremely high temperatures and can sometimes dwarf the usual gas pressure, for instance, in stellar interiors and thermonuclear weapons. Furthermore, large lasers operating in space have been suggested as a means of propelling sail craft in beam-powered propulsion.",0

"Peltosaurus is an extinct genus of anguid lizard from North America that lived from the Eocene to the Oligocene. Peltosaurus belongs to the anguid subfamily Glyptosaurinae. The type species Peltosaurus granulosus was named in 1873 by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Many additional species have been named, but most have been reassigned to different genera. For example, Peltosaurus piger, named in 1928, was reclassified as Odaxosaurus piger, and P. jepseni, named in 1942 from the Paleocene of Wyoming, but was later reclassified as Proxestops jepseni. In 1955 a new species, Peltosaurus macrodon, was named from the Eocene of California. Lizard bones from the Late Miocene of Nebraska were attributed to a new species of Peltosaurus called P. minimus in 1976, extending the fossil range of Peltosaurus and Glyptosaurinae into the Neogene. However, these bones were later referred to a genus of skinks called Eumeces, meaning that the fossil range of Peltosaurus and Glyptosaurinae does not go beyond the Paleogene. The name Peltosaurus was going to be used for the dinosaur now named Sauropelta, but when it was realized that the name was preoccupied, Sauropelta was substituted.",0

"The Milkor MGL (Multiple Grenade Launcher) is a lightweight 40 mm six-shot revolver-type grenade launcher  (variations also fire 37/38mm) developed and manufactured in South Africa by Milkor (Pty) Ltd. The MGL was demonstrated as a concept to the South African Defence Force (SADF) in 1981. The MGL was then officially accepted into service with the SADF as the Y2. After its introduction in 1983, the MGL was gradually adopted by the armed forces and law enforcement organizations of over 50 countries. Total production since 1983 has been more than 50,000 units. The MGL is a multiple-shot weapon, intended to significantly increase a small squad's firepower when compared to traditional single-shot grenade launchers like the M203. The MGL is designed to be simple, rugged, and reliable. It uses the well-proven revolver principle to achieve a high rate of accurate fire which can be rapidly brought to bear on a target. A variety of rounds such as HE, HEAT, anti-riot baton, irritant, and pyrotechnic can be loaded, then fired as fast as the trigger can be pulled; the cylinder can be loaded or unloaded rapidly to maintain a high rate of fire. Although intended primarily for offensive and defensive use with high-explosive rounds, with appropriate ammunition the launcher is suitable for anti-riot and other security operations. A newly patented modification allows the MGL to fire less lethal (very low pressure) rounds.",0

"A fife rail is a design element of a European-style sailing ship used to belay the ship's halyards at the base of a mast.  When surrounding a mast, a fife rail is sometimes referred to specifically by the name of the mast with which it is associated: the main fife rail surrounds the main mast; the mizzen fife rail surrounds the mizzen mast, etc.  It is one of a dozen or so types of ""rails"" often found on such ships.  Fife rails are typically horizontal strips of either wood or iron and are joined and fitted to the tops of a series of stanchions.  The term apparently derives from the location where the ship's fifer would sit and play his fife at heaving of the ship's anchor.
A fife rail surrounding a ship's mast will contain a series of belaying pins corresponding to the sails on that mast which they belay.  A mast will either have a single horseshoe-shaped fife rail surround the base of the mast on the fore, starboard, and port sides, a single straight rail directly before or directly behind the mast, or a set of two fife rails, one on each side (fore and aft) of the mast.
Each sail associated with a given fife rail will have several corresponding belaying pins set into that rail. Although a fife rail is a kind of pin rail, the term ""pin rail"" is often used to specifically denote those rails containing belaying pins that are attached to the hull. Unlike these, fife rails are freestanding.",0

This album was released on EMI/Capitol Records through a deal with Warner Bros. Records. The band had left EMI for Warner in 1991 where they would record their biggest album at the time, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. EMI, who owned the rights to the band's first four albums, decided to cash in on the band's newfound mainstream success.

"EuropaCity was a French planned development outside Paris, initially scheduled to open in 2027. It was a joint project by the French real estate company Immochan and the Chinese investment company Dalian Wanda. It was introduced to the public as a planned 800,000 square metre cultural, recreational, and retail development to be located in the Triangle de Gonesse in Ile-de-France north of Paris. The main purpose of the project was to combine dense urban development with open space.

"Burn My Eye was the debut EP recorded by Sydney punk rock band Radio Birdman, in October 1976. It was a low-budget EP recorded at Trafalgar Studios, Sydney and released on the studio's own Trafalgar label after the band had been rejected by many other labels. Part of the reason that many labels were reluctant to sign the band was because of their unconventional sound, which was quite different from the music then popular in the Australian rock scene during the 1970s. The members of Birdman were not impressed with the acoustics of Trafalgar, a typical 1970s studio which they described as ""dead sounding and quiet"", in contrast to the high tempo, hard-rock sound for which Birdman is known. To the sound engineers' horror, Birdman decided to alter the studio's sound more to their liking by hauling sheets of corrugated iron from nearby demolition sites up the stairs of the studio and covering the walls with them to 'lighten up the sound'.",0
"The Old Assyrian period was the second stage of Assyrian history, covering the history of the city of Assur from its rise as an independent city-state under Puzur-Ashur I  2025 BC to the foundation of a larger Assyrian territorial state after the accession of Ashur-uballit I  1363 BC, which marks the beginning of the succeeding Middle Assyrian period. The Old Assyrian period is marked by the earliest known evidence of the development of a distinct Assyrian culture and was a geopolitically turbulent time when Assur several times fell under the control or suzerainty of foreign kingdoms and empires. The period is also marked with the emergence of a distinct Assyrian dialect of the Akkadian language, a native Assyrian calendar and Assur for a time becoming a prominent site for international trade. For most of the Old Assyrian period, Assur was a minor city-state with little political and military influence. In contrast to Assyrian kings of later periods, the kings in the Old Assyrian period were just one of the prominent actors in the city's administration and normally used the style Išši'ak Aššur, which translates to ""governor (on behalf) of (the god) Ashur"", rather than šar (king). The kings presided over the city's actual administrative body, the city assembly, made up of prominent and influential members among Assur's populace. Though lacking in military and political might, Assur was an important economic center in northern Mesopotamia. From the time of Erishum I ( 1974–1935 BC) until the late 19th century BC, the city was a hub in a large trading network that spanned from the Zagros Mountains in the east to central Anatolia in the west. During their time as prominent traders the Assyrians founded a number of trading colonies at various sites in the trading network, such as Kültepe.",0
"PhotoRC RNA motifs refer to conserved RNA-binding motifs found in some viruses and other eukaryotic cells. These motifs are thought to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and hence are potential targets for antiviral agents.

PhotoRC RNA motifs were first identified in some members of the picornavirus family, including the poliovirus. They are also found in some other eukaryotic cells, such as the human papillomavirus and the bacteriophage λ.

The PhotoRC RNA motifs are characterized by their conserved sequence motifs, which include a putative RNA-binding domain flanked by two C-terminal domains. These motifs have been shown to bind to the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) transcripts of target genes, leading to their regulation.",1

"In the field of pharmacy, compounding (performed in compounding pharmacies) is preparation of a custom formulation of a medication to fit a unique need of a patient that cannot be met with commercially available products. This may be done for medical reasons, such as administration in a different format (ex: tablet to liquid), to avoid a non-active ingredient the patient is allergic to, or to provide an exact dose that isn't commercially available. Medically necessary compounding is referred to as ""traditional"" compounding. It may also be done for medically optional reasons, such as preference of flavor or texture, or dietary restrictions. Hospital pharmacies typically engage in compounding medications for intravenous administration, whereas outpatient or community pharmacies typically engage in compounding medications for oral or topical administration. Due to the rising cost of compounding and drug shortages, some hospitals outsource their compounding needs to large-scale compounding pharmacies, particularly of sterile-injectable medications.",0

"The Hova, or free commoners, were one of the most important social groups in the pre-colonial Malagasy society. They were the backbone of the economy, performing a wide variety of tasks from farming to trading. 

The Hova were able to maintain their independence due to their decentralized organization and their wealth of traditional knowledge. After the French colonization of Madagascar in the late 19th century, the Hova were gradually assimilated into the colonial system. However, they have continued to play an important role in Malagasy society, particularly in rural areas.",1

The series was originally commissioned for broadcast by the British Channel 4, but was cancelled after two episodes had been aired. After being uploaded to YouTube, the show became popular and acquired a large international following. A second series was announced in February 2014, but was later cancelled due to creative differences between Merchant and Ayoade.

Kate & Koji is set in London and primarily focuses on the friendship between Koji, a Japanese exchange student living in London, and Kate, a white British girl. The show tackles a variety of issues such as intercultural relationships, immigration, mental health, and dating. 

Stephen Merchant and Richard Ayoade met while working together on the television comedy series The IT Crowd. After writing the pilot episode of Kate & Koji together, they decided to produce the show themselves rather than sell it to a broadcaster.

The site's consensus reads: ""Though not as clever or original as its creators' earlier work, Kate & Koji is an affable sitcom that's well-acted and frequently touching.""
