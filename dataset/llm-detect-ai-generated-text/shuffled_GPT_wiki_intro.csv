Hope was born in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and was transferred to the Dolphin Research Center in Miami, Florida when she was two months old. She quickly became a favorite of the researchers, who were shocked when they discovered that she could communicate in English.

Hope's unique ability to communicate with humans has allowed her to become an invaluable ambassador for dolphins and help educate people about the species. Her story has been featured on television shows, newspapers, and websites around the world, and she has even been invited to speak at conferences about dolphin conservation.

Hope's ultimate goal is to help protect dolphins worldwide and inspire others to do their part to protect this endangered species.",1
1,"The Invasion of Umuahia (December 20-December 24, 1969) was a military conflict during the Biafran War between Nigerian and Biafran soldiers. The Invasion of Umuahia occurred during the final stages of the Civil War and happened within  15 days of Biafran surrender. Background
Ever since the early stages of the Nigerian Civil War, both sides had been fighting for control of the Imo State. The Imo State was particularly important due to its capital, Owerri. Owerri was first invaded by the Nigerians on September 17, 1968, during Operation OAU and it was kept under Nigerian control until the Capture of Owerri in early 1969. Oguta had been attacked many times before and it became an important city during the war. It lay directly in the path of Owerri but it was heavily fortified by Biafran soldiers. Many roads connecting Oguta and Owerri to Nigerian-controlled cities were purposely destroyed by Biafran soldiers to delay attacks by the Nigerian army. After the large Nigerian loss at Owerri, Col. Benjamin Adekunle was replaced by Col. Olusegun Obasanjo. Since Oguta had been gained and lost two times in the last year, Nigerian Head of State Yakubu Gowon ordered a final attack on Oguta and Owerri.",0

5,"Placental mammals (infraclass Placentalia ) are one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. Placentalia contains the vast majority of extant mammals. Placentals are partly distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother to a relatively late stage of development. The name is something of a misnomer considering that marsupials also nourish their fetuses via a placenta, though for a relatively briefer period, giving birth to less developed young who are then kept for a period in the mother's pouch. Anatomical features
Placental mammals are anatomically distinguished from other mammals by:
 a sufficiently wide opening at the bottom of the pelvis to allow the birth of a large baby relative to the size of the mother.
 the absence of epipubic bones extending forward from the pelvis, which are found in all other mammals. (Their function in non-placental mammals is to stiffen the body during locomotion, but in placentals they would inhibit the expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy.)
 the rearmost bones of the foot fit into a socket formed by the ends of the tibia and fibula, forming a complete mortise and tenon upper ankle joint.
 the presence of a malleolus at the bottom of the fibula.",0

7,"Slavic paganism or Slavic religion describes the religious practices of the Slavic people before their conversion to Christianity in the 7th century. While paganism was never entirely extinguished among the Slavic peoples, it was supplanted by Christianity beginning in the 8th century.

Slavic paganism was a polytheistic religion that revered a variety of gods and goddesses, many of which were similar to those worshiped by the Germanic peoples. Its adherents believed that these deities could help them achieve success in life and ward off evil. Some of the most important Slavic pagan deities were Perun, Svante, Veles, and Dazhbog.

The Slavs were originally nomadic people who lived in present-day Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Russia. In the 6th century, they began to settle down and adopt Christianity. As a result, their pagan beliefs gradually disappeared. Today, traces of Slavic paganism can be found only in folklore and religious ceremonies.",1

The dam is owned by the city of San Diego (Originally owned by the Kumeyaae tribe) and its primary purpose is to supply drinking water. 
In order to make way for the construction of the dam, the native Kumeyaay people were forcibly relocated to the Capitan Grande Reservation. The amount of runoff that enters the reservoir varies considerably. During a 25-year period, it ranged from 1,000 to   per year (39 to 2,700 L/s). The water in the reservoir usually consists of runoff from above the dam, but in years of drought, water is sometimes transferred to it from San Vicente Reservoir, which is the terminus of the First San Diego Aqueduct.   According to the City of San Diego's General Plan Seismic Element, Division of Safety of Dams engineers ""restricted the maximum water surface of El Capitan Dam to an elevation 30 feet lower than spillway, although permitting the temporary storage of storm inflows above the specified level for short periods."" This requirement was added after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, where ""a loss of about 30 feet of dam height resulted"" at the Lower Van Norman Dam due to ""liquefaction of the hydraulic fill on the upstream side of the embankment"".",0

The reaction is as follows:
succinyl-CoA + glycine  δ-aminolevulinic acid + CoA + CO2 This enzyme is expressed in all non-plant eukaryotes and the α-class of proteobacteria and the reaction it catalyses is sometimes referred to as the Shemin pathway for ALA formation. Other organisms produce ALA through a three enzyme pathway known as the C5 pathway. ALA is synthesized through the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA. In humans, transcription of ALA synthase is tightly controlled by the presence of Fe2+-binding elements, to prevent accumulation of porphyrin intermediates in the absence of iron. There are two forms of ALA synthase in the body. One form is expressed in red blood cell precursor cells (ALAS2), whereas the other (ALAS1) is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. The red blood cell form is coded by a gene on chromosome x, whereas the other form is coded by a gene on chromosome 3.",0

Before the 9th century, the Beachley peninsula and the mouth of the Wye were part of the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. A small chapel was founded at what was then the southernmost point of the peninsula - now a tidal island known as Chapel Rock - traditionally in the 4th century by Tecla, a princess of Gwynedd who retired there as a hermit before being murdered by raiders from the sea. A chapel dedicated to St Twrog, perhaps containing a navigation light, was later built on the rock but was ruined before the 18th century.  ",0

77,"A DI unit (direct input or direct inject) is an electronic device typically used in recording studios and in sound reinforcement systems to connect a high-output impedance, line level, unbalanced output signal to a low-impedance, microphone level, balanced input, usually via an XLR connector and XLR cable. DIs are frequently used to connect an electric guitar or electric bass to a mixing console's microphone input jack. The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active buffering or passive impedance matching/impedance bridging to minimize unwanted noise, distortion, and ground loops. DI units are typically metal boxes with input and output jacks and, for more expensive units, “ground lift” and attenuator switches. DI boxes are extensively used with professional and semi-professional PA systems, professional sound reinforcement systems and in sound recording studios. Manufacturers produce a wide range of units, from inexpensive, basic, passive units to expensive, sophisticated, active units. DI boxes may provide numerous features and user-controllable options (e.g., a user-selectable 0dB, 20dB or 40dB pad and/or a ""ground lift"" switch). They may come in different types of enclosures, usually a metal chassis that helps to protect against electrical interference.

79,"Dorit Cypis (born 1951, Tel Aviv) is a Canadian-American artist, mediator and educator based in Los Angeles. Her work has collectively explored themes of identity, history and social relations through installation art, photography, performance and social practice. After graduating from California Institute for the Arts (CalArts), she attracted attention in the 1980s and 1990s for her investigations of the female body, presented in immersive installation-performances at the Whitney Museum, International Center of Photography, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), and Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal. Counter to much feminist work of the time, Cypis focused on interiority and personal mythologies rather than exterior political realms, and according to art historian Elizabeth Armstrong, made a significant contribution to discourse about the representation of women and female sexuality. Cypis's work has often moved between studio and social practice, including the direction and creation of initiatives in Minneapolis and Los Angeles bridging art and social change. As a mediator, she has worked in the Middle East and Los Angeles on conflict engagement issues including Arab-Jewish and police-community relations. Her later art has shifted toward broader considerations of identity related to history, memory, space and geopolitics, and been exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and Orange County Museum of Art.

101,"Kantara Castle  is a castle in Northern Cyprus. The exact date of its construction remains unknown, the most plausible theory being the Byzantine period. It combines Byzantine and Frankish architectural elements, became derelict in 1525 and was dismantled in 1560.  It gave its name to the nearby Kantara monastery. History
Kantara is situated to the east of the Buffavento Castle with the St. Hilarion Castle standing even farther to the west forming a protective axis in the Kyrenia mountain range of Northern Cyprus. As both of the other castles are visible from Buffavento, it was used to pass signals between them. The castles were built in conjunction during the Byzantine period but the date of their commission remains unknown. Among the theories put forward to explain their origin the popular are: In 965 (after the expulsion of the Arabs from the island), in 1091 by the rebel Rhapsomates, during the rule of Eumathios Philokales (1091–1094), in the late 11th century after the Cilician coast was overrun by the Seljuk Empire or in 1096 as a countermeasure for the upheaval caused by the First Crusade.

104,"The 1971 Liberty Bowl was a college football postseason bowl game between the Arkansas Razorbacks and the Tennessee Volunteers, played on December 20, 1971, in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 13th edition of the Liberty Bowl, ninth-ranked Tennessee defeated 18th-ranked Arkansas, 14–13. The game was wrought with controversy, mainly due to two calls in the game by SEC official Preston Watts that favored Tennessee. An Arkansas field goal was wiped out due to a phantom holding call on Arkansas tight end Bobby Nichols. Nichols stated after the game that a Vols player grabbed him and pulled him to the ground, yet Watts flagged Nichols for the holding penalty. The second controversial call came in the fourth quarter when Arkansas fumbled the ball, but Razorback player Tom Reed recovered, and actually handed the ball to Preston Watts. Watts unceremoniously signaled that the ball had been recovered by Tennessee, and gave possession to the Volunteers at the Arkansas 37 yard line. Tennessee would score a touchdown a few plays later to take the lead. Watts was born and raised in Tennessee. This controversy prompted the NCAA to change its rules concerning officiating in bowl games. No longer would bowl game officiating crews be split between the conferences of the competing teams; rather, officiating crews would be composed of officials from conferences not playing in that bowl game.",0

131,"Jack ""Skinny"" Titus (9 March 1908 – 19 April 1978) was an Australian rules football player who played in the Victorian Football League (VFL) between 1926 and 1943 for the Richmond Football Club. In the golden era of the 1930s, Titus was one of the great forwards who regularly thrilled the crowds with spectacular goalkicking feats. A lightly built player who seemed at first glance to be too frail for the robust game of Australian football, Titus proved to be one of the great survivors of the game as he set the record for durability (most consecutive games played) that remained unbeaten for nearly a century. Titus continued to serve Richmond for decades after his retirement, a fact acknowledged by the Australian Football League (AFL), which annually presents the ""Jack Titus Service Award"" for outstanding service to the game. Playing career
Titus was originally recruited to Richmond from Victorian country club Castlemaine competing in the Bendigo Football League. He was noticed by the Tigers' brilliant secretary Percy Page and in 1925 at age 17 invited to play with the Richmond reserves, then known as 'The Cubs'. However, Titus' build caused concern. At just 175 cm and a bit more than 60 kg, Titus would not be considered a potential talent in the modern AFL, let alone play a key forward position as he did then. The Tigers persevered with Titus because of his excellent ball-winning ability and innate goal sense, and hoped that he would gain size as he got older.",0

136,"Hurricane Lili was a relatively long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October 14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October 4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October 16 and then to hurricane status on October 17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October 27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain. Early in its duration, Lili caused flooding in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14 people. Damage was heaviest in Cuba, mostly due to the hurricane's heavy rainfall which totaled 29.41 in (747 mm). The hurricane affected 11 Cuban provinces, damaging 92,542 houses and destroying another 6,369. The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane and banana crops, and overall damage in the country was estimated at $362 million (1996 USD). After 269,995 people were evacuated in advance of Lili, there were no deaths in the country. In nearby Florida, one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm's heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried driving across a flooded roadway. Damage in the Bahamas was not severe, limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300 million in damage (1996 USD) and six deaths.",0

140,"Spathicephalus is an extinct genus of stem-necked lizard from the Early Triassic period. It was described by John Edward Gray in 1856.

The genus contains only one species, Spathicephalus canadensis, which is known from a single fossil specimen found in the Canadian province of Alberta. The specimen is composed of a partial skull and skeleton that measures approximately long. The skull is elongated and narrow-snouted, and features a prominent beak-like snout and short, sharp teeth. The skin is covered in small bumps and scales, and the tail is short and thick.

Based on the limited evidence available, it is unclear whether Spathicephalus was an active predator or scavenger, or whether it specialized in feeding on meat or plant matter. Regardless, it is likely that the species was relatively rare and poorly known during its time alive.",1

These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar backgrounds (such as social class, religion, nationality, ethnicity, education and profession) and opportunities. Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind; as a result, it shapes present social actions of an individual. French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu suggested that the habitus consists of both the hexis (the tendency to hold and use one's body in a certain way, such as posture and accent) and more abstract mental habits, schemes of perception, classification, appreciation, feeling, as well as action. These schemes are not mere habits: Bourdieu suggested they allow individuals to find new solutions without calculated deliberation, based on their gut feelings and intuitions, which he believed were collective and socially shaped. These attitudes, mannerisms, tastes, moral intuitions and habits have influence on the individual's life chances, so the habitus not only is structured by an individual's objective past position in the social structure but also structures the individual's future life path.

A pioneering poet of Kannada's Navōdaya movement and a leading figure in the linguistic renaissance of Kannada in the region of North Karnataka (then part of the Bombay Presidency), Bendre forged a new path in Kannada literature and modern Kannada poetry through his original use of desi Kannada, particularly Dharwad Kannada – the form of Kannada spoken in the North Karnataka region of Dharwad. The richness, originality, and euphony of his poetry, his preternatural feel for the Kannada language, and his charismatic personality would result in him being hailed as a Varakavi (lit. 'boon-gifted poet-seer') by the Kannada people. In a poetic journey that spanned almost 70 years (~ 1914 – 1981), Bendre engaged continuously in what he called Kāvyōdyōga or 'The High Yoga of Poetry'. From very early on, Bendre published his poetry as Ambikātanayadatta . Often mistaken for a pseudonym or pen name (in the western sense), Bendre described Ambikatanayadatta as the ""universal inner voice"" within him that dictated what he, Bendre, then presented in Kannada to the world.",0

202,"The 1985–1986 Hormel strike was a labor union strike by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) at the Hormel meatpacking plant in Austin, Minnesota. It was the largest meatpacking strike in US history.

The strike began on May 14, 1985, and ended on December 6, 1986. It involved over 30,000 workers, and resulted in a loss of $1.5 billion for Hormel. The strike was the longest and most expensive labor conflict in US history up to that point.

The striking workers were primarily employed in the Production Department, where they performed tasks such as wrapping and processing hams. The main issues at stake were pay and benefits, working conditions, and union power.

The UFCW had been trying to unionize the plant for years, but had met with resistance from management. In 1984, the UFCW filed an unfair labor practice charge against Hormel with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB ruled in favor of the union, but Hormel appealed the decision. In March 1985, after months of negotiations failed to produce a settlement, the union called for a strike.

Initially, management offered only modest wage increases and several benefits concessions. However, when these proposals were rejected by the union membership, Hormel increased its offers to include a wage increase of more than 50%, health care benefits for all employees including spouses and children up to age 26, and job security guarantees for employees who joined or re-joined",1

The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions met at the 1921 Imperial Conference to determine a unified international policy, particularly the relationship with the United States and Japan. The most urgent issue was that of whether or not to renew the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which was due to expire on 13 July 1921. On one side were the Prime Minister of Australia, Billy Hughes, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Bill Massey, who strongly favoured its renewal. Neither wanted their countries to be caught up in a war between the United States and Japan, and contrasted the generous assistance that Japan rendered during the First World War with the United States' disengagement from international affairs in its aftermath. ""The British Empire"", declared Hughes, ""must have a reliable friend in the Pacific"". They were opposed by the Prime Minister of Canada, Arthur Meighen, on the grounds that the alliance would adversely affect the relationship with the United States, which Canada depended upon for its security. As a result, no decision to renew was reached, and the alliance was allowed to expire.",0

211,"In neuroscience the bridge locus for a particular sensory percept is a hypothetical set of neurons whose activity is the basis of that sensory percept. The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used. Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be necessary and sufficient for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the sensory perception does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then sensory perception occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a sensory perception. So, for example, retinal neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating visual cortex can give rise to visual percepts. Not all scholars believe in such a neural correlate of consciousness. Pessoa et al., for example, argue that there is no necessity for a bridge locus, basing their argument on the requirement of an isomorphism between neural states and conscious states. Thompson argues that there are good reasons to think that the notion of a bridge locus, which he calls a ""localizationist approach"", is misguided, questioning the premise that there has to be one particular neural stage whose activity forms the immediate substrate of perception. He argues, based upon work by Zeki & Shipp, DeYoe & Van Essen, and others, that brain regions are not independent stages or modules but have dense forward and backward projections that act reciprocally, and that visual processing is highly interactive and context-dependent. He also argues that cells in the visual cortex ""are not mere 'feature detectors, and that neuroscience has revealed that the brain in fact employs distributed networks, rather than centralized representations. He equates the notion of a bridge locus to a Cartesian theatre and suggests that as a notion it should be abandoned.",0

233,"The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to eastern North America. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized. The blue jay feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later; soft fruits; arthropods; and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jays can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have decapitated other birds.",0

The HDI was developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990, and is currently the most widely used human development index. The original objectives of the HDI were to provide a single statistic for measuring the progress of equality and human development, and to provide a comparative measure for monitoring global change.

The HDI is a measure of the relative level of human development of countries. The higher the HDI score, the higher the level of human development. The 2017 Human Development Report produced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found that while there has been significant progress made in reducing poverty and increasing life expectancy around the world since 1990, more work needs to be done to achieve more equitable and sustainable human development.

As a result, all staff are required to be automatically enrolled in a pension scheme when they join a firm. The Cameron Ministry modified this rule by means of the 2011 Pension Act, which brought the rule into force in a series of tranches of employers, over several years (finishing by the end of 2017), instead of all at one moment. The pension scheme involves a portion of one's earnings being put into a fund by both the employer and the employee, in order to save money for their retirement.

247,"The Prague Castle skeleton (given the identification number Mummy 15) is a well-preserved human skeleton of unknown origin that was found in the basement of the Prague Castle in 1876. The skeleton has since been subjected to repeated scientific study and has yielded important information about pre-historic human anatomy.

The Prague Castle skeleton is one of the most famous and well-preserved human skeletons in existence. The skeleton was discovered in the basement of the Prague Castle in 1876 by a workman who was excavating the foundations of the building. At the time, it was believed that the skeleton belonged to a member of the royal family and was buried as part of an elaborate funeral ceremony. However, subsequent scientific study has revealed that the skeleton is far older than originally thought and may date back to prehistoric times.

The Prague Castle skeleton is a remarkably well-preserved specimen of pre-historic human anatomy. The skeleton is missing only two bones – the left leg and right arm – which have both been replaced with prosthetic devices. This allows for an unprecedented level of detail to be observed in the structure of the bones, which has led to important revelations about pre-historic human anatomy.

One of the most significant findings from studying the Prague Castle skeleton is that it reveals significant differences between ancient and modern human anatomy. For example, the skull is much larger on average than that of modern humans, with a wider range of head sizes documented throughout pre-history. Additionally, pre-historic humans had considerably shorter legs than modern",1

249,"Electrorheological (ER) fluids are suspensions of extremely fine non-conducting but electrically active particles (up to 50 micrometres diameter) in an electrically insulating fluid. The apparent viscosity of these fluids changes reversibly by an order of up to 100,000 in response to an electric field. For example, a typical ER fluid can go from the consistency of a liquid to that of a gel, and back, with response times on the order of milliseconds. The effect is sometimes called the Winslow effect after its discoverer, the American inventor Willis Winslow, who obtained a US patent on the effect in 1947 and wrote an article published in 1949. The ER effect 
The change in apparent viscosity is dependent on the applied electric field, i.e. the potential divided by the distance between the plates. The change is not a simple change in viscosity, hence these fluids are now known as ER fluids, rather than by the older term Electro Viscous fluids. The effect is better described as an electric field dependent shear yield stress. When activated an ER fluid behaves as a Bingham plastic (a type of viscoelastic material), with a yield point which is determined by the electric field strength. After the yield point is reached, the fluid shears as a fluid, i.e. the incremental shear stress is proportional to the rate of shear (in a Newtonian fluid there is no yield point and stress is directly proportional to shear). Hence the resistance to motion of the fluid can be controlled by adjusting the applied electric field.",0

The core of this orogeny, the Churchill Craton, is composed of terranes derived from the 1.86–1.81 Ga collision between the Superior and North Atlantic cratons.  The orogeny resulted in the formation of the Nena and Arctica continents, which later merged with other continents to form the Columbia supercontinent.  The name was first proposed by  in reference to what is known as the Penokee Range, sometimes incorrectly called the Gogebic Range, in northern Michigan and Wisconsin. The Paleoproterzoic Penokean orogeny developed in an embayment on the southern margin of the Superior Craton.  It extends east from Minnesota to the Grenville orogen near Lake Huron and south to the Central Plain in Wisconsin.  It is composed of two domains separated by the Niagara Fault Zone: the southern, internal domain, the Wisconsin Magmatic Terranes, consists of Paleoproterzoic tholeiitic and calc-alkaline island arc rocks and calc-alkaline plutonic rocks; the northern, external domain consists of a continental margin foreland basin overlying an Archaean basement and includes the supracrustal rocks of the Animikie Group and Marquette Range Supergroup.  The collision between the two domains around 1.88–1.85 Ga resulted in northward-directed thrusting and folding of the northern domain.",0

Initially, Takara, the Japanese producers of the Transformers toyline, imported the American Transformers cartoon series from 1985 to 1986. When the series came to an end with the three-part miniseries ""The Rebirth"" in 1987, however, Takara decided to continue the series themselves, declining to import The Rebirth and instead creating a full-length 35-episode spin-off series, Transformers: The Headmasters (two additional clips episodes were produced after the fact for direct-to-video release). Supplanting The Rebirth'''s position in Japanese continuity, The Headmasters occurred one year after The Return of Optimus Prime, introducing the title characters to the Transformers universe in a different way. Whereas in western fiction, the Headmasters result from the merging of a Transformer with an organic alien being from the planet Nebulos, the Headmasters of the Japanese series are a group of small Cybertronians who departed the planet millions of years ago and crash-landed on the inhospitable planet Master.

274,"Diadumene lineata, the orange-striped green sea anemone, has several morphotypes which have been described multiple times. Description 
This is a smaller species, measuring approximately 3.5 centimeters in diameter across its tentacles and 3 centimeters in height.  Its central column is green-gray to brown color and smooth.  The column, which houses the gastro vascular central cavity extends from the mouth to the attached base called the pedal disc.  It does not always have vertical stripes, which can be orange or white.  There are 50 to 100 slender and tapered tentacles which are able to retract completely into the column.  They are commonly transparent and can be gray or light green with white flecks (Christine 2001).
Many morphs occur for this species: Sagartia lineata (Verill, 1869 Hong Kong), Diadumene lineata (Verill 1870); Diaumene luciae (Stephenson, 1925);  Haliplanella luciae (Hand, 1955); Properly named D. lineata (Hand 1989). In a single population there may be one or several functioning variations of the species description (Hand, 1955b; Williams, 1973b). Population studies exhibiting morphs of several different communities were done along with personal communication from the following individuals (Parker 1919, Allee 1923, Stephenson 1935).  An un-striped population was found by D.F. Dunn in San Francisco Bay, California.

277,"The Mason County War, sometimes called the Mason County Riots, was a series of three armed conflicts fought in Mason County, Kentucky, between white and black farmers from 1914 to 1921.

The first war, fought from 1914 to 1916, was a result of racial tensions arising from the Agricultural Depression of the 1910s. White landowners in the county exploited black tenant farmers by refusing to pay them their fair share of crops and livestock, leading to many disputes and clashes. The second war, fought from 1921 to 1922, was sparked by a race riot in the town of Masonboro that left several dozen people injured and six dead. The third and final war, fought from 1930 to 1931, was provoked by Ku Klux Klan violence against African-American residents in the county.

The Mason County War is considered one of the most violent episodes of racial violence in American history. More than 2,000 people were injured or killed during the three wars, making it one of the deadliest rural civil wars in American history.",1

Lundin Peak is situated three miles north of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Originally called Snoqualmie Little Sister, the peak's name was changed in 1931 to honor district forest ranger John Lundin. Lundin Peak is a high point on a ridge located midway between Snoqualmie Mountain and Red Mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate
Lundin Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.",0

295,"Student engagement occurs when ""students make a causal connection between their learning experiences and the goals and objectives of the institution"" (Berkner, Simon, & Smith, p. 54). Engagement can be measured in a variety of ways, but the most common way to measure student engagement is by using the Engagement Index developed by the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The NSSE is a national survey that asks students about their experiences in college and how engaged they are in their learning.

Student engagement has been shown to have a positive impact on student outcomes such as graduation rates and retention rates. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association found that ""higher levels of student engagement are associated with better academic outcomes for men and women... Higher levels of student engagement also lead to increased levels of satisfaction with college life, lower levels of stress, and increased persistence in pursuing a degree"" (Berkner, Simon, & Smith, p. 54). In addition, student engagement has been shown to be beneficial for both faculty and administration. Faculty members who are engaged in their work are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and have higher levels of satisfaction with their teaching. In addition, administrators who are engaged in their work are more likely to have higher levels of morale among their staff and to be more effective in managing their institutions.

There are a number of ways that institutions can engage students. One way is through course content. Course content can be designed to engage students by providing opportunities for them to participate in",1
296,"The Tyrrhenian amphora is a specific shape of Attic black-figure neck amphora. Tyrrhenian amphorae were only produced during a short period, about 565 to 550 BC. They are ovoid in shape and bear striking decorations. The handle is usually decorated with a lotus-palmette cross or vegetal tendrils. It always terminates in a red-painted ridge. The vase body is painted with several friezes. The uppermost of these, on the shoulder, is usually especially notable. It often contains mythological scenes, but the first erotic motifs in Attic vase painting also occur here. Unique motifs include the sacrifice of Polyxena. Often, the figures are explained by added inscriptions. The other friezes, usually two to three in number, are often decorated with animals. At times, a frieze is replaced with a vegetal band.

Front: amazonomachy – Herakles combats Andromache, Telamon fights Anipe and Iphis (Herakles’ wife) fights Panariste. Unknown origin, '’circa 550 BC. Athens: National Museum.]] 
The animal friezes and use of colour resemble Corinthian vase painting. It is likely that the Attic vase painters copied Corinthian examples, so as to improve their products’ attractivity on the Etruscan markets. Thus, the Athenian producers entered direct competition with the then market leader, Corinth, by producing features popular in Etruria, such as neck amphorae and colourful decoration. Corinth only produced few neck amphora.
Thus, the Athenians apparently deliberately served a niche market. The Etruscans themselves also produced similar vases. The large majority of the nearly 200 Tyrrhenian amphorae now known were found in Etruria. Early artists to paints such vases include the Castellani Painter and the Goltyr Painter, later ones the Prometheus Painter and the Kyllenios Painter. ",0

299,"Glufosinate (also known as phosphinothricin and often sold as an ammonium salt) is a naturally occurring broad-spectrum herbicide produced by several species of Streptomyces soil bacteria. Glufosinate is a non-selective, contact herbicide, with some systemic action. Plants may also metabolize bialaphos, another naturally occurring herbicide, directly into glufosinate. The compound irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase, an enzyme necessary for the production of glutamine and for ammonia detoxification, giving it antibacterial, antifungal and herbicidal properties. Application of glufosinate to plants leads to reduced glutamine and elevated ammonia levels in tissues, halting photosynthesis and resulting in plant death. Discovery
In the 1960s and early 1970s, scientists at University of Tübingen and at the Meiji Seika Kaisha Company independently discovered that species of Streptomyces bacteria produce a tripeptide they called bialaphos that inhibits bacteria; it consists of two alanine residues and a unique amino acid that is an analog of glutamate that they named ""phosphinothricin"".  They determined that phosphinothricin irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase.  Phosphinothricin was first synthesized by scientists at Hoechst in the 1970s as a racemic mixture; this racemic mixture is called glufosinate and is the commercially relevant version of the chemical.",0

303,"Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied considerably throughout history. In some societies, same-sex relationships are considered immoral, while in others they are seen as natural and even necessary. Throughout the course of human history, there have been many notable people who have been in same-sex relationships, including philosophers, politicians, and artists.

The origins of homosexuality are difficult to discern, as there is no single point at which it first began to be accepted as a sexual orientation. Some historians suggest that it may have arisen from the necessity for homosexual individuals to band together in order to protect themselves from violence or persecution. Others believe that it may have developed as a result of the repression and discrimination that homosexuals have faced throughout history.

Regardless of its origins, homosexuality has always been a controversial subject. Many people view it as immoral, while others see it as a natural expression of love. Throughout history, same-sex relationships have been met with varying degrees of acceptance, ranging from total condemnation to legal recognition. Today, most countries have laws that protect homosexuals from discrimination, but there is still much work to be done in terms of fully understanding and accepting homosexuality as a valid form of sexuality",1

It is theorized that Paduli was the ancient Roman settlement of Batulum. The most likely theory regarding the origin of the name ""Paduli"" proposes the name ""Batulum"" changed to ""Padulum"", which in Vulgar Latin meant ""marsh"". It is from ""padulem"" that the Italian term ""padule"" - the plural form of which is ""paduli"" - is derived. Indeed, the identification of Paduli as Batulum comes from the similarly hilled and swampy environment both areas are known to have occupied, and the earliest confirmed mention of Paduli records the town's name as ""Padule"". Furthermore, the Italian settlement of Colle Sannita, around 10 miles from Paduli, preserves an ancient name for the general area of Benevento it occupies called ""Padula"" - which also means ""marsh"" or ""swamp"".",0

328,"John Major (or Mair; also known in Latin as Joannes Majoris and Haddingtonus Scotus; 1467–1550) was a Scottish philosopher, theologian, and historian who was much admired in his day and was an acknowledged influence on all the great thinkers of the time. A renowned teacher, his works were much collected and frequently republished across Europe. His ""sane conservatism"" and his sceptical, logical approach to the study of texts such as Aristotle or the Bible were less prized in the subsequent age of humanism, when a more committed and linguistic/literary approach prevailed. His influence in logic (especially the analysis of terms), science (impetus and infinitesimals), politics (placing the people over kings), Church (councils over Popes), and international law (establishing the human rights of ""savages"" conquered by the Spanish) can be traced across the centuries and appear decidedly modern, and it is only in the modern age that he is not routinely dismissed as a scholastic. His Latin style did not help – he thought that ""it is of more moment to understand aright, and clearly to lay down the truth of any matter than to use eloquent language"". Nevertheless, it is to his writings, including their dedications, that we owe much of our knowledge of the everyday facts of Major's life – for example his ""shortness of stature"". He was an extremely curious and very observant man, and used his experiences – of earthquakes in Paisley, thunder in Glasgow, storms at sea, eating oatcakes in northern England – to illustrate the more abstract parts of his logical writings.

336,"The Lacaune is a breed of domestic sheep originating near Lacaune in southern France. The native region of these sheep is the Tarn and Aveyron departments and surrounding areas. This region is collectively known as the ""Roquefort Sector"" which references the milk collection area. The Lacaune is the most widely used dairying sheep breed in France, with a population of about 800,000 ewes. Notably, it is the predominant breed used in the production of Roquefort cheese in France. History 
Sheep first came to that region of France around 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. The land was rough and desolate but the sheep could adapt well to it. In the mid-19th century, farmers began to add genetics from other local breeds to produce a hardy breed of sheep that produced a rich milk and good meat. This was the development of the dual-purpose breed of original Lacaune. The Lacaune has been used as a milking sheep in France for a very long time, but milking wasn't the dominant feature of the breed until recently. In the late 1960s, the average milk yield per ewe was only about 70 liters during the human milking period (and excluding the lamb suckling period) per annum.",0

338,"A stress test, in financial terminology, is an analysis or simulation designed to determine the ability of a given financial instrument or financial institution to deal with an economic crisis. Instead of doing financial projection on a ""best estimate"" basis, a company or its regulators may do stress testing where they look at how robust a financial instrument is in certain crashes, a form of scenario analysis. They may test the instrument under, for example, the following stresses:
 What happens if unemployment rate rises to v% in a specific year?
 What happens if equity markets crash by more than w% this year?
 What happens if GDP falls by x% in a given year?
 What happens if interest rates go up by at least y%?
 What if half the instruments in the portfolio terminate their contracts in the fifth year?
 What happens if oil prices rise by z%?
 What happens if there is a polar vortex event in a particular region? This type of analysis has become increasingly widespread, and has been taken up by various governmental bodies (such as the PRA in the UK or inter-governmental bodies such as the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the International Monetary Fund) as a regulatory requirement on certain financial institutions to ensure adequate capital allocation levels to cover potential losses incurred during extreme, but plausible, events. The EBA's regulatory stress tests have been referred to as ""a walk in the park"" by Saxo Bank's Chief Economist.
This emphasis on adequate, risk adjusted determination of capital has been further enhanced by modifications to banking regulations such as Basel II. Stress testing models typically allow not only the testing of individual stressors, but also combinations of different events. There is also usually the ability to test the current exposure to a known historical scenario (such as the Russian debt default in 1998 or 9/11 attacks) to ensure the liquidity of the institution. In 2014, 25 banks failed in stress test conducted by EBA.",0
339,"The ZIS-115 is a Soviet built armored version of the ZIS-110 limousine, designed and built especially for Joseph Stalin. 32 of the cars were manufactured between 1948-49. The heavily armored car's design was based on the American 1942 Packard Super Eight. The car weighed over 4 tonnes, windows made of glass nearly 3 inches thick (each of which weighed over ) were powered by a hydraulic system. Its 6.0-liter (366 cubic inches) straight-eight engine (an upgraded version of the ZIS-110 engine) generated 162 horsepower with a top speed of 75 mph.
Stalin, extremely paranoid of assassination, always rode in the rear of the car, seated between two armed bodyguards.
He never rode in the same armored ZIS two days in a row, and frequently changed the route driven from his home in Kuntsevo to the Kremlin. After Stalin's death in 1953, the armored ZIS limousines continued to be used for many years by successive Soviet leaders. Today, several of the cars still exist and are owned by private collectors and museums around the world.

345,"Cylindraspis is a genus of recently extinct sphenodontosaurid dinosaurs. The genus is known from bones and teeth found in the Late Cretaceous of Montana and South Dakota in the United States.

The type species is C. walkeri, described by paleontologist Stephen L. Jay Gould in 1984. The genus is based on a single skull and partial skeleton, which was found in 1982 by amateur fossil hunter Richard T. Thompson.

Cylindraspis walkeri is one of the most complete sphenodontosaurid skeletons ever discovered, and has been used to help reconstruct the morphology of this group of dinosaurs. The genus is distinguished from other sphenodontosaurids by its shorter forelimbs and enlarged, faceted rostrum. Cylindraspis are considered to be the ancestors of the more well-known tyrannosaurids.

There is currently only one known species of Cylindraspis, C. walkeri. However, recent research has suggested that there may have been multiple species within the genus, with some specimens classified as C. walkeri and others classified as new genera such as Laramidia and Borealopelta. The exact number of species within the genus remains unknown, but it is likely that there were at least two or three.",1

352,"The evolution of cetaceans is thought to have begun in the Indian subcontinent from even-toed ungulates 50 million years ago (mya) and to have proceeded over a period of at least 15 million years. Cetaceans are fully aquatic marine mammals belonging to the order Artiodactyla and branched off from other artiodactyls around 50 mya. Cetaceans are thought to have evolved during the Eocene or earlier and to share a relatively recent closest common ancestor with hippopotami. Being mammals, they surface to breathe air; they have 5 finger bones (even-toed) in their fins; they nurse their young; and, despite their fully aquatic life style, they retain many skeletal features from their terrestrial ancestors. Research conducted in the late 1970s in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea. The two modern parvorders of cetaceans – Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) – are thought to have separated from each other around 28-33 mya in a second cetacean radiation, the first occurring with the archaeocetes. The adaptation of animal echolocation in toothed whales distinguishes them from fully aquatic archaeocetes and early baleen whales. The presence of baleen in baleen whales occurred gradually, with earlier varieties having very little baleen, and their size is linked to baleen dependence (and subsequent increase in filter feeding).",0

These ants will set up quarters in the ground, in cracks in concrete walls, in spaces between boards and timbers, even among belongings in human dwellings. In natural areas, they generally nest shallowly in loose leaf litter or beneath small stones, due to their poor ability to dig deeper nests. However, if a deeper nesting ant species abandons their nest, Argentine ant colonies will readily take over the space.",0

357,"A dental aerosol is an aerosol that is produced from dental instrument, dental handpieces, three-way syringes, and other high-speed instruments. These aerosols may remain suspended in the clinical environment. Dental aerosols can pose risks to the clinician, staff, and other patients. The heavier particles (e.g., >50 µm ) contained within the aerosols are likely to remain suspended in the air for relatively short period and settle quickly onto surfaces, however, the lighter particles may remain suspended for longer periods and may travel some distance from the source. These smaller particles are capable of becoming deposited in the lungs when inhaled and provide a route of diseases transmission. Different dental instruments produce varying quantities of aerosol, and therefore are likely to pose differing risks of dispersing microbes from the mouth. Air turbine dental handpieces generally produce more aerosol, with electric micromotor handpieces producing less, although this depends on the configuration of water coolant used by the handpiece. Composition 
These dental aerosols are bioaerosols which may be contaminated with bacteria, fungi, and viruses from the oral cavity, skin, and the water used in dental units. Dental aerosols also have micro-particles from dental burs, and silica particles which are one of the components of dental filling materials like dental composite. Depending upon the procedure and site, the aerosol composition may change from patient to patient. Apart from microorganisms, these aerosols may consist of particles from saliva, gingival crevicular fluid, blood, dental plaque, calculus, tooth debris, oronasal secretions, oil from dental handpieces, and micro-particles from grinding of the teeth and dental materials. They may also consist of abrasive particles that are expelled during air abrasion and polishing methods.",0

359,"Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the validity of laws relating to U.S. citizenship at birth for children born outside the United States, out of wedlock, to an American parent. The Court declined to overturn a more restrictive citizenship requirement applying to a foreign-born child of an American father and a non-American mother who was not married to the father, as opposed to a child born to an American mother under similar circumstances. Background
Section 309 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as amended (codified as section 1409 of Title 8 of the United States Code) deals with U.S. citizenship for children born outside the U.S., out of wedlock, to an American parent. If a child is born abroad, out of wedlock, to an American mother, the child automatically acquires U.S. citizenship at birth, provided the mother had ""previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year"". An illegitimate foreign-born child of an American father and an alien mother, on the other hand, is recognized as a U.S. citizen only if a much more complex and stringent set of conditions are met: the father's paternity must be convincingly established prior to the child's 18th birthday, and the father must also agree in writing to provide financial support to the child until he or she reaches age 18.",0
360,"Acrochordus granulatus is a snake species found from India through Southeast Asia to the Solomon Islands. It is known as the little file snake, marine file snake, and little wart snake. It is completely aquatic and almost helpless on land. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description
Acrochordus granulatus is the smallest of the three members of the family Acrochordidae, and is commonly called the ""little file snake"". Acrochordus granulatus is also the only Acrochord that permanently inhabits estuaries as well as coastal seas, dawning its other common name the ""marine file snake"". All members of Acrochordus are completely aquatic and nearly helpless on land. As with the other members of the genus, Acrochordus granulatus has uniquely spinose scales with an almost rough texture. Members of Acrochordus also possess specialized tubercles with nerve endings on the skin between their scales which provide an extra sensory organ used to feel water movements of prey. Acrochordus granulatus also have laterally compressed tails, and they can flatten dorsoventrally to assist in swimming. Acrochordus granulatus are the most marine of the Acrochordidae and have specialized sublingual salt glands similar to those found in the true sea snake subfamily Hydrophiinae. Despite this, they are still susceptible to dehydration at sea and rely on freshwater lenses built up on the surface of marine water for freshwater. Members of the true sea snake subfamily Hydrophiinae have been shown to exhibit this same behavior. Acrochordus granulatus are sexually divergent, with females being slightly larger than males.",0

It lives in groups of two to 70 individuals, usually splitting the group into smaller subgroups when active. Taxonomy
The taxonomy of the common woolly monkey is still debated. Fooden classified it is as one of two species under the genus Lagothrix with four sub-species (L. l. lagotricha, L. l. lugens, L. l. cana, and L. l. poeppgigii. Later, an analysis of craniodental morphology suggested a move of all sub-species to the species level and also led to the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (formerly Lagothrix flavicauda) being moved to a monotypic genus Oreonax. Genetic analyses also identify distinct groups, but different groupings from morphological and molecular data continue to make this a difficult issue that might be addressed with larger data sets. A 2014 study found the genus Lagothrix to comprise only two species: L. lagothrica and L. flavicauda, with L. lagothrica containing five subspecies; the results of this study have been followed by the American Society of Mammalogists and the IUCN Red List.",0

372,"Castiel  (nicknamed ""Cas"") is a fictional character portrayed by Misha Collins on The CW's American fantasy television series Supernatural. An Angel of the Lord, he first appears in the fourth season and is used to introduce the theme of Christian theology to the series. In the series, Castiel brings Dean Winchester back from Hell and frequently helps him and his brother, Sam, in their battles with various demons and angels along the way. During his travels with the Winchesters, Castiel develops friendships with both men. As an angel, he possesses a number of supernatural abilities, including the ability to kill demons. Initially, the character demonstrates complete devotion to God and little emotion. However, his interactions and experiences with Dean and Sam, as well as certain revelations about God and his fellow angels, have a humanizing effect on him. This, despite the stress and harm it causes his character, allows him to develop an independent will as the series progresses and helps the show address topics related to free will.    Unlike the stereotypical portrayal of television angels, Castiel does not always help people, and is willing, at least when he is first introduced, to kill innocents if needed. Collins originally read for the part of a demon, as series creator Eric Kripke did not want fans to find out that angels were being introduced to the series. Collins prepared for the role by reading the Book of Revelation and based his portrayal on his younger brother. Critics and fans have responded highly favorably to the character. In response, the show's creators expanded his role in the series, upgrading him to a main cast member in the fifth and sixth seasons. After being a special guest star in the seventh and eighth seasons, Collins was upgraded once again to regular cast member status through seasons 9–15.",0

Very mercurial, he changes careers rapidly from cater waiter, Banana Republic and Barneys New York sales clerk, to acting teacher, to student nurse, to surfer, to back-up dancer for Jennifer Lopez and Janet Jackson.

Molar Tooth is a granite pillar half a mile north on the ridge extending to Cutthroat Pass. Climate
Cutthroat Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below  or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.",0

390,"Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument by the mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) for the existence of God. The argument is in a line of development that goes back to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109). St. Anselm's ontological argument, in its most succinct form, is as follows: ""God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in reality. Therefore, God must exist."" A more elaborate version was given by Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716); this is the version that Gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument. Gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers. Points relevant to the ontological proof include
4. There are other worlds and rational beings of a different and higher kind.
5. The world in which we live is not the only one in which we shall live or have lived.

391,"The Battle of Náchod (German: Nachod) on 27 June 1866 was the first major action of the Austro-Prussian War. The advance guard of General Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz's 5th Corps occupied some high ground near Náchod as part of a Prussian advance into Bohemia from Silesia. Elements of the Austrian 6th Corps under General Von Ramming came on the scene and attacked the Prussians but were repulsed. As more Austrians arrived, they were ordered into attacks which proved both costly and unsuccessful. Finally, the badly mauled Austrians retreated from the field. The Prussian infantry enjoyed a technical advantage in having the needle gun, a breech-loading rifle that could be fired and loaded from a prone position. Consequently, the Austrian infantry, which were only equipped with muzzle-loading rifles, suffered a disproportionate number of casualties. Events
The Prussian Second Army, invading Bohemia, had to split up in order to negotiate the passes of the Riesen Mountains (Krkonoše). General Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz's 5th Corps was nearly caught as it emerged from a gully by the town of Nachod, Bohemia.

392,"Norwood College was a private boys' school in Norwood, Massachusetts, United States. It closed in 2010 due to declining enrollment and financial problems.

Norwood College was founded in 1892 as a private boys' school. The school was originally located on Beacon Street in Norwood, but relocated to its current campus on West Boylston Street in 1909. During the early years, the school was a selective school, admitting only the top students from throughout Massachusetts. However, over the years it became more open, enrolling students from all areas of the state.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Norwood College experienced significant growth, both in terms of student enrollment and in terms of its facilities. This growth was due in part to the efforts of then-president William J. Cleary III, who built new dormitories and other facilities on campus. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, Norwood College had begun to experience significant financial problems. In 2007, president Cleary announced that the college would be closing down due to declining enrollment and financial problems. The final class graduated in 2010.

394,"The Satellite Control Network (SCN), operated by the United States Space Force's Space Delta 6, provides support for the operation, control, and maintenance of a variety of United States Department of Defense and some non-DoD satellites. This involves continual execution of Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&C) operations. In addition, the SCN provides prelaunch checkout and simulation, launch support, and early orbit support while satellites are in initial or transfer orbits and require maneuvering to their final orbit. The SCN provides tracking data to help maintain the catalog of space objects and distributes various data such as satellite ephemeris, almanacs, and other information. It was previously known as the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while under Air Force Space Command's 50th Network Operations Group. Overview
The Satellite Control Network consists of satellite control centers, tracking stations, and test facilities located around the world. Satellite Operations Centers (SOCs) are located at Schriever Space Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and various other locations throughout the continental United States. These SOCs are staffed around the clock and are responsible for the command and control of their assigned satellite systems. The SOCs are linked to remote tracking stations (RTSs) around the world. Space vehicle checkout facilities are used to test launch vehicles and satellite platforms to ensure that the onboard systems operate within specifications. The RTSs provide the link between the satellites and the SOCs. A similar relationship exists for dedicated networks, which are outside the purview of the Satellite Control Network. RTSs around the world are needed to maintain frequent communications with the satellite. Without RTSs, the SOCs would only be able to contact a satellite when it came into the control center's view. Some satellites, especially those in geostationary orbit, never come within view of their control center. Each antenna at an RTS is referred to as a ""side"". Previously, Side A typically included a  dish antenna. Side B typically included a  antenna. At some sites, the B side included a  antenna. Over time, however, as the network upgraded and/or replaced the antennas, the old conventions no longer apply.",0
395,"Augmented reality-assisted surgery (ARAS) is a surgical tool utilizing technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a surgeon’s view of the operative field, thus providing a composite view for the surgeon of the patient with a computer generated overlay enhancing the operative experience. It can be used for training, preparation for an operation, or performance of an operation. ARAS can be performed using a wide array of technology, including an optical head-mounted display (OHMD)—such as the Google Glass XE 22.1 or Vuzix STAR 1200 XL—and a digital overlay from robotic and laparoscopic surgery feeds. The technique has been primarily been tested in the urological and cardiovascular domains. Specialized uses
A subset of called augmented reality-assisted urologic surgery (ARAUS) specifically aids with urological surgery. This intraoperative training tool was first described and utilized by Tariq S. Hakky, Ryan M. Dickey, and Larry I. Lipshultz within the Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, and Daniel R. Martinez, Rafael E. Carrion, and Philippe E. Spiess within the Sexual Medicine Program in the Department of Urology, at the University of South Florida. It was initially used to teach medical residents how to place a penile implant from start to finish via an application downloaded onto the OHMD. Intraoperatively, an optical display camera output feed combined with software allowing for the detection of points of interest enabled faculty to interact with residents during the placement of the penile implant. Both faculty and residents demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction of the ARAUS experience, and it was shown to be an effective tool in training urological surgical technique. Advantages of ARAUS include real-time feedback of residents during suy and superior visibility and interaction between faculty and residents.",0

409,"A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm or a lightning storm, is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Relatively weak thunderstorms are sometimes called thundershowers. Thunderstorms occur in a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds and often produce heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, or hail, but some thunderstorms produce little precipitation or no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction. Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a front. However, some kind of cloud forcing, whether it is a front, shortwave trough, or another system is needed for the air to rapidly accelerate upward. As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, condenses, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface. As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.",0

434,"In mathematics, an ∞-topos is, roughly, an ∞-category such that its objects behave like sheaves of spaces with some choice of Grothendieck topology; in other words, it gives an intrinsic notion of sheaves without reference to an external space. The prototypical example of an ∞-topos is the ∞-category of sheaves of spaces on some topological space. But the notion is more flexible; for example, the ∞-category of étale sheaves on some scheme is not the ∞-category of sheaves on any topological space but it is still an ∞-topos. Precisely, in Lurie's Higher Topos Theory, an ∞-topos is defined as an ∞-category X such that there is a small ∞-category C and a left exact localization functor from the ∞-category of presheaves of spaces on C to X. A theorem of Lurie states that an ∞-category is an ∞-topos if and only if it satisfies an ∞-categorical version of Giraud’s axioms in ordinary topos theory. A ""topos"" is a category behaving like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space. In analogy, Lurie's definition and characterization theorem of an ∞-topos says that an ∞-topos is an ∞-category behaving like the category of sheaves of spaces.",0

Sustainability accounting has been growing in popularity as an increasingly important tool for corporations and governments to measure their environmental and social impacts and to develop strategies for sustainable management. Sustainability accounting can help organizations identify areas of improvement, make informed investment decisions, and devise effective mitigation and adaptation plans.

In order for a business or organization to be considered sustainable, it must meet three criteria: environmental sustainability (meeting legal requirements such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)), social sustainability (being compatible with human rights), and economic sustainability (operating in a manner that allows the company to continue operation over time).

464,"Wireless speakers are loudspeakers that receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. The two most popular RF frequencies that support audio transmission to wireless loudspeakers include a variation of WiFi IEEE 802.11, while others depend on Bluetooth to transmit audio data to the receiving speaker. Overview
Wireless speakers are composed of two units: a main speaker unit combining the loudspeaker itself with an RF receiver, and an RF transmitter unit. The transmitter connects to the audio output of any audio devices such as hi-fi equipment, televisions, computers, MP3 players, etc. An RCA plug is normally used to achieve this. The receiver is positioned where the listener wants the sound to be, providing the freedom to move the wireless speakers around without the need of using cables. The receiver/speaker unit generally contains an amplifier to boost the audio signal to the loudspeaker; it is powered either by batteries or by an AC electric outlet.  ",0

483,"Gliogenesis is the generation of non-neuronal glia populations derived from multipotent neural stem cells. Overview
Gliogenesis results in the formation of non-neuronal glia populations from neuronal  cells. In this capacity, glial cells provide multiple functions to both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Subsequent differentiation of glial cell populations results in function-specialized glial lineages. Glial cell-derived astrocytes are specialized lineages responsible for modulating the chemical environment by altering ion gradients and neurotransmitter transduction. Similarly derived, oligodendrocytes produce myelin, which insulates axons to facilitate electric signal transduction. Finally, microglial cells are derived from glial precursors and carry out macrophage-like properties to remove cellular and foreign debris within the central nervous system ref. Functions of glial-derived cell lineages are reviewed by Baumann and Hauw. Gliogenesis itself, and differentiation of glial-derived lineages are activated upon stimulation of specific signaling cascades. Similarly, inhibition of these pathways is controlled by distinct signaling cascades that control proliferation and differentiation. Thus, elaborate intracellular-mechanisms based on environmental signals are present to regulate the formation of these cells. As regulation is much more known in the CNS, its mechanisms and components will be focused on here. Understanding the mechanisms in which gliogenesis is regulated provides the potential to harness the ability to control the fate of glial cells and, consequently, the ability to reverse neurodegenerative diseases.",0

522,"Predatory conferences or predatory meetings are meetings set up to appear as legitimate scientific conferences but which are exploitative as they do not provide proper editorial control over presentations, and advertising can include claims of involvement of prominent academics who are, in fact, uninvolved. They are an expansion of the predatory publishing business model, which involves the creation of academic publications built around an exploitative business model that generally involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals. Overview
Jeffrey Beall coined the term ""predatory meetings"" as analogous to ""predatory publications"" and explains that the business model involves ""conferences organized by revenue-seeking companies that want to exploit researchers' need to build their vitas with conference presentations and papers in the published proceedings or affiliated journals,"" these affiliated journals being predatory journals. Early-career academics and scholars from developing countries are the most likely to be at risk of exploitation by predatory meetings, just as is the case with the predatory publications. Predatory meetings have been reported to accept submissions of very poor quality, to claim that uninvolved academics are on the organising committee, and to deliberately mimic well-established conferences to gain submissions. Organisers of predatory meetings include the World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology (WASET) and the OMICS Publishing Group; however, there are many other organizations directly targeting students, faculty, and other researchers with invitations to participate in this type of conferences. The Caltech Library website has a list of questionable conferences and conference organizers. In 2016 the Federal Trade Commission launched a case against OMICS regarding its predatory journals and conferences and in 2019 a federal judge ruled that OMICS made deceptive claims to academics and researchers about the nature of their conferences and publications and ordered Srinubabu Gedela (CEO and owner of OMICS) and his companies to pay more than 50 million dollars.",0

GRACE was founded in 2003 after a reporter called Boz Tchividjian about a case of sexual abuse mishandled by a pastor. He became convinced that Evangelical institutions were not properly addressing incidents of sexual abuse, incidents that he believed would eventually lead to scandals similar to those that had damaged the Catholic Church. In Tchividjian's view, the authoritarian culture of some Protestant organizations was particularly susceptible to what he called ""spiritual abuse""—the attempt of religious leaders to silence victims or convince them that they deserved their abuse. Tchividjian has stated that ""When it comes to child sexual abuse, too many churches and Christian organizations prefer to sacrifice individuals in order to protect themselves. We end up living out the very antithesis of the Gospel that we preach. The consequences are devastating.""",0

Previously, WBKI-TV maintained separate studios at the Kaden Tower on Dutchmans Lane in Louisville's Bowman section (along I-264/US 60/Henry Watterson Expressway), while the WDRB/WMYO facilities only housed WBKI-TV's master control and some internal operations. Even though WBKI-TV broadcast a digital signal of its own, the station's broadcasting radius did not reach the northern portions of the Louisville market, particularly on the Indiana side. Therefore, the station was simulcast over WMYO's digital subchannels in order to reach the entire market. Following the sale of WBKI-TV's spectrum in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s incentive auction, WBKI-TV ceased broadcasting on October 25, 2017 (with its license canceled on October 31); its channels are now broadcast solely through WMYO (which assumed the WBKI-TV call sign on February 12, 2018) on that station's license.",0

Many of the living great Korean ceramicists of today resulted from the South Korean government's program in the mid-20th century to rediscover the secrets of ancient Korean celadon ceramics from the Goryeo Dynasty, one of the pinnacles of Korean ceramic arts. After graduating from Hongik University in Seoul, Shin began his career by recreating this traditional blue-green celadon as well as buncheong. After a brief sojourn in London as a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Art (1995–1997) where he was exposed particularly to African art, he returned to Korea with an abruptly different style from the traditional work of his early years, fusing both western and eastern design in his work.

556,"In the philosophy of mind, mind–body dualism denotes either the view that mental phenomena are non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable. Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem. Aristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to people only. In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level. For Aristotle, the first two souls, based on the body, perish when the living organism dies, whereas remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind. For Plato, however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body. It has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers, since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body, and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenon.",0

574,"Froment's sign is a special test of the wrist for palsy of the ulnar nerve, specifically, the action of adductor pollicis.  Froment's maneuver can also refer to the cogwheel effect from contralateral arm movements seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Process of examination
To perform the test, a patient is asked to hold an object, usually a flat object such as a  piece of paper, between the thumb and index finger (pinch grip). The examiner then attempts to pull the object out of the subject's hands. 
 A normal individual will be able to maintain a hold on the object without difficulty. 
 However, with ulnar nerve palsy, the patient will experience difficulty maintaining a hold and will compensate by flexing the flexor pollicis longus of the thumb to maintain grip pressure causing a pinching effect.  
Clinically, this compensation manifests as flexion of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb (rather than adduction, as would occur with correct use of the adductor pollicis).
The compensation of the affected hand results in a weak pinch grip with the tips of the thumb and index finger, therefore, with the thumb in obvious flexion.
Note that the flexor pollicis longus is normally innervated by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve.  
Anterior interosseous branch comes off more proximally than the wrist, in evaluating lacerations near the wrist.
Simultaneous hyperextension of the thumb MCP joint is indicative of ulnar nerve compromise.  This is also known as Jeanne's sign.",0

579,"The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), also known by the acronym EAB, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to north-eastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to Europe and North America. Before it was found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control. History",0

As an autodidact, he developed pictorial concepts at the interface with the sciences. ""For decades, Pümpel has been addressing philosophical and scientific questions, which are given pictorial form in his conceptual-oriented art. His thinking is determined by problems of time and space that have been an intensive subject of art since the early 20th century, the materiality of manifestations, questions of quantum physics and the theory of probability."" (Christoph Bertsch, 2007) His works have included entropic drawings (starting in 1976), laser projects (1980) and work on the theory of black holes (1981) and Schrödinger's cat paradox (2005/2008).

Jones, Richard Fenno, Allen Schick, Dennis Ippolito, Naomi Caiden, Irene Rubin, James D. Savage, Thomas Greitens, Gary Wamsley, and Usman W. Chohan.  Budget theory was a central topic during the Progressive Era and was much discussed in municipal bureaus and other academic and quasi-academic facilities of that time such as the nascent Brookings Institution. The executive budget in United States was a financial innovation designed to empower city mayors and city managers with the capacity to implement needed policy reforms in the Progressive Era.  Since that time, the executive budget has become a tool by which the president of the United States has been able to substantively shape policy and draw power to the president from Congress, which was originally charged with ""holding the purse"" (and still is constitutionally, as there is no federal-legislative authority to change the constitution outside the amendment process or for congress to legislate away their authority).

589,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a branch of clinical chemistry and clinical pharmacology that specializes in the measurement of medication levels in blood. Its main focus is on drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, i.e. drugs that can easily be under- or overdosed. TDM aimed at improving patient care by individually adjusting the dose of drugs for which clinical experience or clinical trials have shown it improved outcome in the general or special populations.  It can be based on a a priori pharmacogenetic, demographic and clinical information, and/or on the a posteriori measurement of blood concentrations of drugs (pharmacokinetic monitoring) or biological surrogate or end-point markers of effect (pharmacodynamic monitoring). There are numerous variables that influence the interpretation of drug concentration data: time, route and dose of drug given, time of blood sampling, handling and storage conditions, precision and accuracy of the analytical method, validity of pharmacokinetic models and assumptions, co-medications and, last but not least, clinical status of the patient (i.e. disease, renal/hepatic status, biologic tolerance to drug therapy, etc.).",0

607,"In mathematics and statistics, a stationary process (or a strict/strictly stationary process or strong/strongly stationary process) is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time. To get an intuition of stationarity, one can imagine a frictionless pendulum. It swings back and forth in an oscillatory motion, yet the amplitude and frequency remain constant. Although the pendulum is moving, the process is stationary as its ""statistics"" are constant (frequency and amplitude). However, if a force were to be applied to the pendulum (for example, friction with the air), either the frequency or amplitude would change, thus making the process non-stationary. Since stationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data are often transformed to become stationary. The most common cause of violation of stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due either to the presence of a unit root or of a deterministic trend. In the former case of a unit root, stochastic shocks have permanent effects, and the process is not mean-reverting. In the latter case of a deterministic trend, the process is called a trend-stationary process, and stochastic shocks have only transitory effects after which the variable tends toward a deterministically evolving (non-constant) mean.",0

Austronesians reached the northernmost Philippines, specifically the Batanes Islands, by around 2200 BCE. Austronesians were the first people to invent oceangoing sailing technologies (notably catamarans, outrigger boats, lashed-lug boat building, and the crab claw sail), which enabled their rapid dispersal into the islands of the Indo-Pacific. From 2000 BCE they assimilated (or were assimilated by) the earlier Paleolithic Negrito, and Australo-Melanesian Papuan populations.

He was a leading advocate of the League of Nations to enable the international community to avoid wars and end hostile aggression. Wilsonianism is a form of liberal internationalism. Principles
Common principles that are often associated with ""Wilsonianism"" include:
 Advocacy of the spread of democracy. Anne-Marie Slaughter writes that Wilson expected and hoped ""that democracy would result from self-determination, but he never sought to spread democracy directly."" Slaughter similarly writes that Wilson's League of Nations was similarly intended to foster liberty democracy by serving as ""a high wall behind which nations"" (especially small nations) ""could exercise their right of self determination"" but that Wilson did not envision that the U.S. would affirmatively intervene to ""direct"" or ""shape"" democracies in foreign nations.

630,"The theory of structuration is a social theory of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is based on the analysis of both structure and agents (see structure and agency), without giving primacy to either. Furthermore, in structuration theory, neither micro- nor macro-focused analysis alone is sufficient. The theory was proposed by sociologist Anthony Giddens, most significantly in The Constitution of Society, which examines phenomenology, hermeneutics, and social practices at the inseparable intersection of structures and agents. Its proponents have adopted and expanded this balanced position. Though the theory has received much criticism, it remains a pillar of contemporary sociological theory. Premises and origins
Sociologist Anthony Giddens adopted a post-empiricist frame for his theory, as he was concerned with the abstract characteristics of social relations. This leaves each level more accessible to analysis via the ontologies which constitute the human social experience: space and time (""and thus, in one sense, 'history'."") His aim was to build a broad social theory which viewed ""[t]he basic domain of study of the social sciences... [as] neither the experience of the individual actor, nor the existence of any form of societal totality, but social practices ordered across space and time.""

Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves, the best-known example being Geoffrey Chaucer's Wife of Bath. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand.

636,"Epitope mapping is the process of experimentally identifying the binding site, or ""epitope"", of an antibody on its target antigen (usually, on a protein). Identification and characterization of antibody binding sites aid in the discovery and development of new therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. Epitope characterization can also help elucidate the mechanism of binding for an antibody and can strengthen intellectual property (patent) protection. Experimental epitope mapping data can be incorporated into robust algorithms to facilitate in silico prediction of B-cell epitopes based on sequence and/or structural data.
Epitopes are generally divided into three classes: linear, conformational and discontinuous. Linear epitopes are formed by a continuous sequence of amino acids in a protein. In Conformational epitopes the binding residues are contained within certain key protein structural conformations, such as in helices, loops or beta sheets. The conformation of the epitope is important for bringing binding residues in the correct positions. Finally, discontinuous epitopes consist of parts of the antigen that are not close in the protein sequence but are brought together by three-dimensional protein folding. Discontinuous epitopes can harbour linear and conformational parts. B-cell epitope mapping studies suggest that most interactions between antigens and antibodies, particularly autoantibodies and protective antibodies (e.g., in vaccines), rely on binding to discontinuous epitopes.

It was used as a meeting house until about 1878, with its dual use as a school beginning c. 1870.  It was dedicated for academic use in 1878, after the local Universalist congregation which had been using for services, built its own dedicated building.  This building is said to have acquired its distinctive weathervane as a gift in 1870 from schoolmaster Bartholomew Van Dame. The building was moved closer to the center in 1952, at which time it was mounted on a concrete foundation, and a sympathetic addition was made to increase its capacity.  In 1995 a new central elementary school was built, and the addition was converted for use as a police station.  This building was again moved to provide parking space for the police, and has been adapted for use as a local history museum and community center.",0

It began on August 21, when deputies of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) initiated action to apprehend and arrest Randy Weaver under a bench warrant after his failure to appear on firearms charges. Given three conflicting dates for his court appearance, and suspecting a conspiracy against him, Weaver refused to surrender, and members of his immediate family, and family friend Kevin Harris, resisted as well. The Hostage Rescue Team of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI HRT) became involved as the siege developed. During the USMS reconnoiter of the Weaver property, six U.S. Marshals encountered Harris and Weaver's 14-year-old son, Sammy, in woods near the family cabin. A shootout took place. Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, Sammy Weaver, and the Weavers' dog, Striker, all died as a result. In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver's wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire. All casualties occurred in the first two days of the operation.

685,"(Sea Devil, also known as the  (Elephant)) was a two-man amphibious midget submarine, developed by Nazi Germany during World War II. Only one prototype was built in 1944, although its testing was relatively successful and negotiations began for another series of three to test the necessary changes before beginning series production in 1945. These plans were cancelled at the beginning of that year when the decision was made to concentrate production on designs already being built. Background and description
The Neger and Marder human torpedoes and the Biber midget submarines were difficult to launch from anywhere other than a harbor. The special preparations required to do so limited their operational flexibility and required additional time and resources. Alois Lödige and several of his colleagues of the Kiel-Eckernförde torpedo testing center developed the concept of putting tracks on a midget submarine to allow it to move on and off a beach under its own power. They designed and built a proof-of-concept vehicle in early 1944 that was tested in March. The one-man  (special vessel) was  long and displaced  without armament. It mounted a pair of torpedoes low on the hull by the tracks.",0

687,"The Kashubian diaspora resulted from the emigration of Kashubians mainly in two waves occurring in the second half of the 19th century. The majority of Kashubian emigrants settled in the United States; others emigrated to Canada and Brazil. An online genealogical project, ""The Great Kashubian Migration,"" is devoted to tracking their settlement patterns. Their reasons for emigration varied. Until the Franco-Prussian War, Kashubians emigrated primarily for economic reasons. After the Franco-Prussian War and especially due to the Kulturkampf, Kashubian emigration accelerated as socio-political factors came into play. In his 1899 book, Statystyka ludnosci kaszubskiej (Statistics of the Kashubian Population), the Kashubophile linguist and sociologist Stefan Ramult estimated that 130,700 Kashubians were living in the Americas. Reasons for emigration
The primary reason for emigration was economic. Kashubian farmers were not targeted by Prussian laws immediately after 1850. As the eminent Kashubian scholar, Professor Józef Borzyszkowski of Gdańsk University has observed, Kashubs were more or less comfortable with Prussian governance at the time. Rather, smallholders of all ethnicities were disadvantaged because the greater part of arable Pomeranian land already belonged to estate owners, and what remained was not particularly fertile. Another problem was the population boom among the Kashubs and Poles. Large families were typical of devout Roman Catholics, and in this particular case children were welcomed as additional workers. Once grown to maturity, however, the surfeit of young people were a further drain upon Pomerania's already strained fortunes. Recognizing this situation, the Prussian government tried to free up land by encouraging (but not forcing) Kashubs and Poles to emigrate. One very early incentive was inexpensive or even free travel to North America.",0

699,"Eyewitness memory is a person's episodic memory for a crime or other dramatic event that he or she has witnessed. Eyewitness testimony is often relied upon in the judicial system. It can also refer to an individual's memory for a face, where they are required to remember the face of their perpetrator, for example. However, the accuracy of eyewitness memories is sometimes questioned because there are many factors that can act during encoding and retrieval of the witnessed event which may adversely affect the creation and maintenance of the memory for the event.  Experts have found evidence to suggest that eyewitness memory is fallible.
It has long been speculated that mistaken eyewitness identification plays a major role in the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals. A growing body of research now supports this speculation, indicating that mistaken eyewitness identification is responsible for more convictions of the innocent than all other factors combined. This may be due to the fact that details of unpleasant emotional events are recalled poorly compared to neutral events. States of high emotional arousal, which occur during a stressful or traumatic event, lead to less efficient memory processing. The Innocence Project determined that 75% of the 239 DNA exoneration cases had occurred due to inaccurate eyewitness testimony. It is important to inform the public about the flawed nature of eyewitness memory and the difficulties relating to its use in the  criminal justice system so that eyewitness accounts are not viewed as the absolute truth.

The word has its origin in the Latin trapetum that means oil mill. From the Sicilian language trappitu the term, crossing the Mozarab Valencia, with its typical change of termination to «-ig» via the Catalan language (trapig -Gandía, 1536-, trapitz de canyamel -Mallorca, 1466-) has arrived to the other languages of the Iberian peninsula as trapiche. In the documents of the Duke of Gandía from the beginning of the fifteen century, one can see the term «trapig de canyamel», as a synecdoche to indicate the whole village engenho. According to Herrera: ""..es de notar que antiguamente no auuia azucar,ſino en Valencia"" (""note that in the old days there was no sugar except in Valencia"").",0

C. argenteoalba are diurnal, which means they are active during the day. Each individual has a unique appearance due to their differences in the ratio of black to silver coloring on their abdomen. Spiders with less silver coloring are better at catching prey, since the silver is bright and warns their prey. They catch their prey by waiting in the hub of their web until their prey is close enough to catch. Parasitic larvae are often found attached to C. argenteoalba, and the larvae are able to manipulate the spider's behavior. Females are on average 2 mm longer in size than males. During mating, female genital mutilation is common in order to increase the fitness of the male. On their webs, they often attach silk “decorations” that are thought to deter predators. Relocating to a different place to build a new web occurs frequently until they find a location with a significant amount of prey. Description",0

748,"Dundee Law is a hill in the centre of Dundee, Scotland, and is the highest point in the city. The Law is what remains of a volcanic sill, which is the result of volcanic activity around 400 million years ago. With a large war memorial at its summit, it is the most prominent feature on the local skyline. Geology
Dundee Law, which takes its name from a Scots word for a prominent hill, is an example of a volcanic sill. A volcanic area miles to the west forced lava through fissures in Old Red Sandstone. The subsequent action of rain, wind and ice eroded the sandstone, revealing the volcanic rock. Glaciers during the ice ages deposited more debris around the base, creating a crag and tail. The shallow gradient of the northern and eastern slopes of the law suggest a north-easterly movement of ice flows. The summit of the hill is over  above sea level.  Despite the derivation of ""law"" making it tautological to do so, the Law is commonly referred to as the ""Law Hill"".",0

Bayesian model reduction is a method for reducing the number of degrees of freedom in a Bayesian model. It is an optimization technique that can be used to improve the fit of a Bayesian model to data. It does this by finding a set of parameters that best explains the data, given the assumptions made about the model.

Bayesian model reduction can be used in two main ways: it can be used to find a simpler model that is better suited to data, or it can be used to find a more accurate model that has fewer degrees of freedom.",1

It is a collaboration between a high school district and a community college for high school students who desire a more independent learning environment. Students take a combination of core high school courses and college courses to receive their diploma and graduate. Although students are required to take courses to fulfill their academic requirements, some schools allow students to have a choice of a variety of classes to fulfill said requirements. Students are allowed to attribute the college credits earned in middle college toward their future college career after they graduate and they are also allowed to combine those together. The core classes are provided by teachers employed by the high school district while all the college courses are taken with real college students at the community college.

762,"Oportunidades (English: Opportunities; now rebranded as Prospera) is a government social assistance program in Mexico founded in 2002, based on a previous program called Progresa, created in 1997. It is designed to target poverty by providing cash payments to families in exchange for regular school attendance, health clinic visits, and nutrition support. Oportunidades is credited with decreasing poverty and improving health and educational attainment in regions where it has been deployed.
Key features of Oportunidades include:
 Conditional cash transfer (CCT): To encourage co-responsibility, receipt of aid is dependent on family compliance with program requirements, such as ensuring children attend school and family members receive preventative health care.
 ""Rights holders"": Program recipients are mothers, the caregiver directly responsible for children and family health decisions.
 Cash payments are made from the government directly to families to decrease overhead and corruption.
 A system of evaluation and statistical controls to ensure effectiveness.
 Rigorous selection of recipients based on geographic and socioeconomic factors.
 Program requirements target measures considered most likely to lift families out of poverty, focusing on health, nutrition and children's education. Oportunidades championed the conditional cash transfer (CCT) model for programs instituted in other countries, such as a pilot program in New York City, the Opportunity NYC, and the Social Protection Network in Nicaragua.  Other countries that have instituted similar conditional cash transfer programs include Brazil, Peru, Honduras, Jamaica, Chile, Malawi and Zambia.",0

775,"Herbal distillates, also known as floral waters, hydrosols, hydrolates, herbal waters, and essential waters, are aqueous products of hydrodistillation. They are colloidal suspensions of essential oils as well as water-soluble components obtained by steam distillation or hydrodistillation (a variant of steam distillation) from plants/herbs. These herbal distillates have uses as flavorings and cosmetics (skin care). Popular herbal distillates for skincare include rose water, orange flower water, and witch hazel. Rosemary, oregano and thyme are very popular hydrosols for food production. Production 
Herbal distillates are produced in the same or similar manner as essential oils. However, essential oils will float to the top of the distillate where it is removed, leaving behind the watery distillate. For this reason the term essential water is an apt description. In the past, these essential waters were often considered a byproduct of distillation, but are now considered an important co-product. The produced herbal waters are essentially diluted essential oils at less than 1% concentration (typically 0.01% to 0.04%). Several factors, such as temperature and an herb's growth cycle, impact the characteristics of a distillate, and therefore influence the timing of the distillation. Rosemary, for example, should be distilled in the peak of summer before it flowers.",0

The Central Freeway begins at a directional ""Y"" interchange at the west end of Interstate 80 in the South of Market neighborhood, and travels west above Division Street and 13th Street. This interchange also includes access between the Bayshore Freeway, which carries US 101 to the south, and the one-way pair of 9th and 10th Streets. As it approaches the end, US 101 exits onto Mission Street to access Van Ness Avenue, which it follows north to Lombard Street and the Golden Gate Bridge. The remainder of the freeway is signed as exit 434B from US 101, and comes to the surface at Market Street and Octavia Boulevard, the latter continuing north to Oak and Fell Streets, a one-way pair west to Golden Gate Park. No traffic from Market Street is allowed to turn onto the freeway, but traffic from the freeway may turn right onto Market. The first opportunity for traffic that instead continues onto the boulevard to leave it is east on Page Street.",0

780,"Asplenium bradleyi, commonly known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently throughout much of the Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A. bradleyi originated when that sterile diploid hybrid underwent chromosome doubling to become a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent doublings of sterile diploid hybrids. A. bradleyi can also form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts. While A. bradleyi is easily outcompeted by other plants in more fertile habitats, it is well adapted to the thin, acidic soil and harsh environment of its native cliffs, where it finds few competitors. Its isolated situation on these cliffs protects it from most threats, but quarrying and mining of the cliffs, rock climbing, and other activities that disturb the cliff ecosystem can destroy it.",0

783,"The Hamburg Rules are a set of rules governing the international shipment of goods, resulting from the United Nations International Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea adopted in Hamburg on 31 March 1978. The Convention was an attempt to form a uniform legal base for the transportation of goods on oceangoing ships. A driving force behind the convention was the attempt by developing countries' to provide all participants a fair and equal chance of succeeding. It came into force on 1 November 1992. History
The first of the international conventions on the carriage of goods by sea was the Hague Rules of 1924.   In 1968, the Hague Rules  were updated to become the Hague-Visby Rules, but the changes were modest. The convention still covered only ""tackle to tackle"" carriage contracts, with no provision for multimodal transport. The industry-changing phenomenon of containerization was barely acknowledged.  The 1978 Hamburg Rules were introduced to provide a framework that was both more modern, and less biased in favour of ship-operators.  Although the Hamburg Rules were readily adopted by developing countries, they were shunned by richer countries who stuck with Hague and  Hague-Visby. It had been expected that a Hague/Hamburg compromise might arise, but instead the more extensive Rotterdam Rules appeared.",0

791,"Checkerboarding is a term used in beekeeping that describes a specific hive management technique to prevent swarming. The technique was developed by Walt Wright, a long time beekeeper from Tennessee. Checkerboarding takes advantage of the bee colony's primary motivation, which is survival as survival of the existing colony takes priority over swarm preparation and swarming. Bees will not prepare for a reproductive swarm if they perceive the survival of the existing colony might be jeopardized. It is hypothesized that swarm preparation starts in the late winter. The over-wintering colony consumes honey and expands the brood volume. At this point, the bee colony apparently senses that it has enough remaining honey stores and a large enough brood nest to risk swarm preparation. The bee colony's first activity of swarm preparation is to reduce the brood volume by creating additional stores inside the brood area. As brood emerges, selected cells are back-filled with honey, nectar, or pollen. Later into the season, as space for egg laying decreases the queen will not be able to lay as many eggs. This forces the queen to diet and lose weight so she becomes fit for the swarm flight.",0

794,"Zeno is the common anglicised form of the Greek name Zenon, which means ""savior"" or ""deliverer"". The name has been borne by a number of notable figures in Greek and European history.

Zeno was born in Elea, in Magna Graecia (now part of Calabria), around the mid-fourth century BC. He became one of the most renowned and influential Greek thinkers of his time, and is best known for his philosophical doctrines on motion, knowledge, and reality. He is also remembered for his paradoxes, which challenge conventional wisdom.

Zeno's most famous paradox is the Parable of the Arrow. In it, he argues that a moving arrow cannot be captured in its flight by any stationary object it passes by; rather, it must pass through the stationary object twice (once going inwards and once coming outwards). This problem has been known to perplex both philosophers and mathematicians for centuries.

Zeno also made significant contributions to physics, including the theory of optics and the theory of motion. He is also credited with being the first to develop a mathematical theory to describe natural phenomena such as waves and water droplets.",1
795,"Purgatorio (; Italian for ""Purgatory"") is the second part of Dante's Divine Comedy, following the Inferno and preceding the Paradiso.  The poem was written in the early 14th century. It is an allegory telling of the climb of Dante up the Mount of Purgatory, guided by the Roman poet Virgil—except for the last four cantos, at which point Beatrice takes over as Dante's guide. Allegorically, Purgatorio represents the penitent Christian life. In describing the climb Dante discusses the nature of sin, examples of vice and virtue, as well as moral issues in politics and in the Church. The poem outlines a theory that all sins arise from love – either perverted love directed towards others' harm, or deficient love, or the disordered or excessive love of good things. Overview of Purgatory 
In the poem, Purgatory is depicted as an island-mountain in the Southern Hemisphere. This realm is divided into three parts. The bottom slopes of Mount Purgatory (Purgatorio I–IX) have been designated as ""Ante-Purgatory"" by commentators. Purgatory proper consists of seven levels or terraces (Purgatorio X–XXVII) of suffering and spiritual growth, associated with the seven deadly sins. Finally, the Earthly Paradise is located at the top of the mountain (Purgatorio XXVIII–XXXIII).",0

The mainline Protestant churches trace their roots back to the Reformation of the 16th century. They rejected the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and formed their own churches, which differed from each other in their beliefs and practices.

Today, mainline Protestant churches are divided into two main groups: the Southern and Northern branches. The Southern branch consists of churches in the United States, Canada, Central America, and South America. The Northern branch includes churches in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

813,"Aptera fusca, the Cape Mountain cockroach, giant cockroach or Table Mountain cockroach, is a large cockroach which is widespread on low vegetation in open areas  in the fynbos biome of the Western Cape region of South Africa. Adult females can be from  long. Males are slightly smaller (body length ) and have dark brown wings, which are absent in females. It is stoutly built, with a reddish head and brown to black body segments with prominent yellow margins. The femora are heavily spined, with the hind tibiae having two very broad ridges with only two rows of spurs. They are nocturnal and herbivorous. Unusually for insects, it gives birth to 18–24 live offspring and protects the young for a while after giving birth. Family groups are found in late summer and autumn: a brood of black nymphs, a wingless female and two or more males, all living in a hidden crack. When alarmed, it raises its abdomen into the air and squeaks loudly; it also releases a foul-smelling liquid from glands on the back  when handled and alarmed, producing an indelible brown stain on skin. The only other species in the genus Aptera, A. munda, is rare, and is found in the Richtersveld. References",0
814,"Thalamotomy  is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the thalamus to improve the overall brain function in patients. First introduced in the 1950s, it is primarily effective for tremors such as those associated with Parkinson's disease, where a selected portion of the thalamus is surgically destroyed (ablated).  Neurosurgeons use specialized equipment to precisely locate an area of the thalamus, usually choosing to work on only one side (the side opposite that of the worst tremors).  Bilateral procedures are poorly tolerated because of increased complications and risk, including vision and speech problems.  The positive effects on tremors are immediate.  Other less destructive procedures are sometimes preferred, such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation, since this procedure can also improve tremors and other symptoms of PD. Indications
Thalamotomy is a complex procedure performed by specialist neurosurgeons. It is mostly indicated in cases of stroke, damage to third ventricle of brain, brain hemorrhage, accidents leading to head injury, oedema around thalamus, subdural hemorrhage, and cerebrovascular accident. There is also some evidence in thalamocortical dysrhythmia.",0

822,"Blanching is a technique used in vegetable growing. Young shoots of a plant are covered to exclude light to prevent photosynthesis and the production of chlorophyll, and thus remain pale in color. Different methods used include covering with soil (hilling or earthing up) or with solid materials such as board or terracotta pots, or growing the crop indoors in darkened conditions. Blanched vegetables generally tend to have a more delicate flavor and texture compared to those that are not blanched, but blanching can also cause the vegetables to be lower in vitamin A. Examples
Vegetables that are usually blanched include:<ref

There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.

The area now known as Knightsbridge was part of the manor of Barnet. The manor had two parts, Old Barnet and New Barnet. The site of Knightsbridge was part of the New Barnet part. In 1421, a charter was granted to the Bishop of London to hold a market and fair on Wednesdays and Saturdays in the area now known as Knightsbridge.

He built himself a pleasure palace in the form of a tiltyard on the site, which he called The Kings Playhouse. He also created an extensive garden, which can still be seen today.

During the reign of Charles I, the palace was used as a military headquarters and several battles were fought in its vicinity, most notably the Battle of Worcester (1651).

The Maravatio shiner is found in a single pool around a spring near the town of Maravatio in Michoacan. In visits by researchers between 2004 and 2007 the species was not found. The small spring is enclosed by houses and is under intense human usage or recreation and sanitation. Exotic fish guppies (Poecilia reticulata), Twospot livebearers (Heterandria bimaculata) and Oreochromis sp. have been introduced and this could explain the possible absence of N. marhabatiensis from the spring. This species has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species but its describers state that the species should be considered in danger of extinction and so should be evaluated as Critically Endangered.",0
875,"The AN/SPG-59 was an advanced PESA phased array radar developed by the U.S. Navy starting in 1958.  It was one of the earliest phased array radars.  AN/SPG-59 was intended to offer search, track and guidance from a single radar system and antenna as part of the Typhon combat system. Paired with the new Typhon missile, the system was to provide wide-area air defense out to about  from suitable anti-aircraft cruisers. Both the radar and missile proved to be well beyond the state of the art of the era, and the project was eventually canceled in December 1963. The Typhon Combat System
The Typhon/SPG-59 started as a response to the introduction of sea-skimming anti-ship missiles into service with Soviet Naval Aviation groups. First-generation missile systems like Talos and Terrier used a combination of beam riding and semi-active radar homing (SARH) that required a special targeting radar to illuminate the target through the entire interception. Typical installations included either two or four such illumination radars, which limited the number of simultaneous interceptions. Facing volleys of missiles such systems could easily be overwhelmed.",0
876,"The ukelin is a bowed psaltery with zither strings made popular in the 1920s.  It is meant to be a combination of the violin and the Hawaiian ukulele.  It lost popularity prior to the 1970s because the instrument was difficult to play and often returned to the manufacturer before it had been completely paid for. History
The history of the ukelin is hard to trace, since there were several instruments resembling the ukelin that were produced in the 1920s.  Paul F. Richter filed the first known ukelin patent in December 1924, it was granted in April 1926. The Phonoharp Company, which merged with Oscar Schmidt, Inc. the same year, began producing ukelins in 1926. However, an instrument greatly resembling the ukelin had had its patent filed in 1923, a year before Richter filed his; yet the patent, filed by John Large, was not granted until after Richter's patent had already been given. Another similar instrument had a patent filed by Walter Schmidt in 1925.  Because of these patents filed one after the other it is unclear who really invented the first ukelin.",0

891,"S-Nitrosylation is the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide group (-NO) to cysteine thiol within a protein to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). S-nitrosylation has diverse regulatory roles in bacteria, yeast and plants and in all mammalian cells. It thus operates as a fundamental mechanism for cellular signaling across phylogeny and accounts for the large part of NO bioactivity. S-nitrosylation is precisely targeted, reversible, spatiotemporally restricted and necessary for a wide range of cellular responses, including the prototypic example of red blood cell mediated autoregulation of blood flow that is essential for vertebrate life. Although originally thought to involve multiple chemical routes in vivo, accumulating evidence suggests that S-nitrosylation depends on enzymatic activity, entailing three classes of enzymes (S-nitrosylases) that operate in concert to conjugate NO to proteins, drawing analogy to ubiquitinylation. S-Nitrosylation was first described by Stamler et al. and proposed as a general mechanism for control of protein function, including examples of both active and allosteric regulation of proteins by endogenous and exogenous sources of NO. The redox-based chemical mechanisms for S-nitrosylation in biological systems were also described concomitantly. Important examples of proteins whose activities were subsequently shown to be regulated by S-nitrosylation include the NMDA-type glutamate receptor in the brain. Aberrant S-nitrosylation following stimulation of the NMDA receptor would come to serve as a prototypic example of the involvement of S-nitrosylation in disease. S-nitrosylation similarly contributes to physiology and dysfunction of cardiac, airway and skeletal muscle and the immune system, reflecting wide-ranging functions in cells and tissues. It is estimated that ~70% of the proteome is subject to S-nitrosylation and the majority of those sites are conserved. S-Nitrosylation is thus established as ubiquitous in biology, having been demonstrated to occur in all phylogenetic kingdoms and has been described as the prototypic redox-based signalling mechanism, hypothesized to have evolved on primordial Earth.",0

Caroline Scarles states that these exchanges may include silence, yet ""while such silences may create disjuncture and fractures in conversation, the mutuality of visual autoethnography mobilizes spaces of comfort and understanding as an unspoken 'knowing' emerges between respondent and researcher as those-who-have-experienced.""",0

904,"An Injection Pump is the device that pumps fuel into the cylinders of a diesel engine. Traditionally, the injection pump was driven indirectly from the crankshaft by gears, chains or a toothed belt (often the timing belt) that also drives the camshaft. It rotates at half crankshaft speed in a conventional four-stroke diesel engine. Its timing is such that the fuel is injected only very slightly before top dead centre of that cylinder's compression stroke. It is also common for the pump belt on gasoline engines to be driven directly from the camshaft.  In some systems injection pressures can be as high as 620 bar (8992 psi)  . Safety
Because of the need for positive injection into a very high-pressure environment, the pump develops great pressure—typically 15,000 psi (100 MPa) or more on newer systems. This is a good reason to take great care when working on diesel systems; escaping fuel at this sort of pressure can easily penetrate skin and clothes, and be injected into body tissues with medical consequences serious enough to warrant amputation.",0

908,"Tikal Temple VI (also known as the Temple of the Inscriptions and Structure 6F-27) is a Mesoamerican pyramid in the ruins of the major Maya city of Tikal, in the Petén department of northern Guatemala. Temple VI is located at the southeastern end of the Mendez Causeway, which links the temple plaza with the site core. The temple faces west onto a walled plaza. The existence of the temple was first reported in 1951 by Antonio Ortiz on behalf of the Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH - ""Institute of Anthropology and History""). The roof comb of the temple is inscribed on its sides and back with a lengthy hieroglyphic text. The pyramid's summit superstructure contains two chambers, and the highest surviving portion of the temple's roof comb stands  high. The pyramid superstructure is accessed via three west-facing doorways. The triple doorway and interior layout of the chambers suggest that Temple VI was in fact a palace-type structure rather than a temple. Hieroglyphic inscription 
The text contains a history of Tikal stretching back into the Preclassic period. The earliest date in the text equates to 1139 BC; it records either a mythical foundation event or, perhaps, a distantly remembered historical event of importance.",0

923,"The culture of Morocco represents and is shaped by a confluence of influences throughout history. This sphere may include, among others, the fields of personal or collective behaviors, language, customs, knowledge, beliefs, arts, legislation, gastronomy, music, poetry, architecture, etc. ... While Morocco started to be stably predominantly Sunni Muslim starting from 9th-10th century AD, in the Almoravids empire period, a very significant old Jewish population had contributed to the shaping of Moroccan culture. In antiquity, starting from the second century A.D and up to the seventh, a rural Donatist Christianity was present, along an urban still-in-the-making Roman Catholicism. All of the cultural super strata tend to rely on a multi millennial aboriginal Amazigh substratum still strongly present and dates back to prehistoric times. The linguistic landscape of Morocco is complex. It generally tends to be horizontally diverse and vertically stratified. It is though possible to broadly classify it into two main components: Amazigh and Semitic. It is hardly possible to speculate about the origin of Amazigh languages as it is traced back to low antiquity and prehistoric times. The Semitic influence, on the contrary, can be fairly documented by archaeological evidence. It came in two waves: Canaanite, in its Punic, Carthaginian and Hebrew historic varieties, from the ninth century B.C and up to high antiquity, and Arabic, during the low Middle Ages, starting from the seventh century A.D. The two Semitic languages being close, both in syntax and vocabulary it is hard to tell them apart as to who influenced more the structure of modern Maghrebi. The Arab conquerors having certainly encountered large romanized urban Punic population as they advanced. In any case, the linguistic and cultural identity of Morocco, just as its geography would predict, is the result of the encounter of three main circles: African Amazigh, Semitic and Western Mediterranean European.",0

It formerly included all other Philippine tarictic hornbills as subspecies, in which case the common name of the 'combined species' was shortened to tarictic hornbill. Taxonomy
The Visayan hornbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Buceros panini in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The type locality is the island of Panay in the Philippines. The Visayan hornbill is now placed in the genus Penelopides that was introduced in 1849 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in a plate of the hornbills. The origin of the generic name is uncertain but it may be a combination of the Latin pene meaning ""almost"" or ""nearly"", the Ancient Greek lophos meaning ""crest"" and -oideēs ""resembling"". The specific epithet panini is a Latinized form of ""Panay"". The common English name refers to the Visayan Islands.

It is believed to have been located in the eastern Nile Delta, lower Egypt; perhaps at or near Avaris, the seat of power of the Hyksos kings. Meaning of the name
If the Septuagint reading ""Gesem"" is correct, the word, which in its Hebrew form has no known meaning, may mean ""cultivated""—comparing the Arabic root j-š-m, ""to labor"". Egyptologists have suggested a connection with the Egyptian word qis, meaning ""inundated land"".

By combining multiple geochronological (and biostratigraphic) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.

Biostratigraphy does not directly provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an interval of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted.

988,"Longwood Cricket Club is a tennis and former cricket club based in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States. It is the site of the first Davis Cup competition. History
A club for cricket was opened in 1877 at Longwood Estate, a place named after the house Napoleon Bonaparte stayed at while exiled to Saint Helena. Located on the outskirts of Boston on land donated by the Sears family, cricketers and baseball players put Longwood on the sports map. Specifically, Harry Wright, first player-manager of the Boston Red Stockings, played cricket for the United States, as did his brother George Wright. George Wright combined with tennis pro Charlie Chambers in league games throughout New England and played at Longwood against Lord Harris' XI in 1891. George Wright was the co-proprietor of Wright and Ditman, purveyor of fine sports goods. Wright brought the first tennis gear to Boston on his return from a baseball-cricket tour of England in 1874. Wright also taught tennis to Harvard students and toured with them in California in 1890. It was George Wright who deserves the credit for Longwood's broad-based sporting tradition, having excelled in baseball and cricket as a paid professional and at tennis as a promoter of the game. A lawn tennis court was laid in 1878, two years after the organization of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. On January 5, 1888, Longwood member and US cricket team captain C.L. Bixby led the team to a win over the West Indies cricket team at the Bourda ground in Georgetown, Guyana. Richard D.

1004,"Attachment in children is ""a biological instinct that promotes close emotional and physical proximity between a child and caregiver"". The goal of attachment is for the child to feel safe and secure, and to form strong emotional bonds with the caregiver.

Attachment in children is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics and early experiences. Some children are more likely to form attachments than others, and may require special attention or care to elicit a strong response. Attachment can be disrupted in a variety of ways, including abuse, neglect, or separation from the caregiver. If left unaddressed, attachment disruptions can lead to a range of problems, including anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues.

There is no one answer to how to promote attachment in children. However, interventions that focus on addressing childhood trauma are often effective at promoting healthy attachments.

In 1754, Godeheu gave up with the English the Indian territories, especially Madras, which had been conquered in 1746 by Dupleix and left the French with the Deccan region. From 1751 Dupleix's star began to wane. Robert Clive, a discontented young British factor who had left the countinghouse for the field, seized the fort of Arcot, political capital of Karnataka, with 210 men in August 1751. This daring stroke had the hoped-for effect of diverting half of Chanda Sahib's army to its recovery. Clive's successful 50-day defense permitted Mohamed Ali Khan Walajan to procure allies from Tanjore and the Marathas. The French were worsted, and they were eventually forced to surrender in June 1752. Dupleix never recovered from this blow and was superseded in August 1754 by his director Godehou, who made an unfavourable settlement with the British. On 26December 1754, he signed the Treaty of Pondicherry with Thomas Saunders, the English East India Company's resident at Madras, that forbade the British and French companies all political activity in India and the activity must be strictly commercial.",0

1014,"Employee recognition is the timely, informal or formal acknowledgement of a person's behavior, effort, or business result that supports the organization's goals and values, and exceeds his superior's normal expectations. Recognition has been held to be a constructive response and a judgment made about a person's contribution, reflecting not just work performance but also personal dedication and engagement on a regular or ad hoc basis, and expressed formally or informally, individually or collectively, privately or publicly, and monetarily or non-monetarily (Brun & Dugas, 2008). Theoretical foundation 
The track of scientific research around employee recognition and motivation was constructed on the foundation of early theories of behavioral science and psychology. The earliest scientific papers on employee recognition have tended to draw upon a combination of needs-based motivation (for example, Hertzberg 1966; Maslow 1943) theories and reinforcement theory (Mainly Pavlov 1902; B.F.

Hiberno-Latin was notable for its curiously learned vocabulary. While neither Hebrew nor Greek was widely known in Europe during this period, odd words from these sources, as well as from Irish and British sources, were added to Latin vocabulary by these authors. It has been suggested that the unusual vocabulary of the poems was the result of the monks learning Latin words from dictionaries and glossaries which did not distinguish between obscure and common words; unlike many others in Western Europe at the time, the Irish monks did not speak a language descended from Latin.  During the sixth and seventh centuries AD, Irish monasticism spread through Christian Europe; Irish monks who founded these monasteries often brought Hiberno-Latin literary styles with them.",0

1020,"Mirrored-self misidentification is the delusional belief that one's reflection in the mirror is another person – typically a younger or second version of one's self, a stranger, or a relative. This delusion occurs most frequently in patients with dementia and an affected patient maintains the ability to recognize others' reflections in the mirror. It is caused by right hemisphere cranial dysfunction that results from traumatic brain injury, stroke, or general neurological illness. It is an example of a monothematic delusion, a condition in which all abnormal beliefs have one common theme, as opposed to a polythematic delusion, in which a variety of unrelated delusional beliefs exist. This delusion is also classified as one of the delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS). A patient with a DMS condition consistently misidentifies places, objects, persons, or events. DMS patients are not aware of their psychological condition, are resistant to correction and their conditions are associated with brain disease – particularly right hemisphere brain damage and dysfunction. Prevalence
Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) can occur in patients with a wide variety of cranial dysfunctions. Mirrored-self misidentification, a type of DMS, occurs most typically in patients with dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. Approximately 2% to 10% of all patients with Alzheimer's disease have mirrored-self misidentification. Patients with schizophrenia, right frontal ischemic stroke, and rarely patients with Parkinson's disease have also reported being affected by this delusion. The exact prevalence of patients with this delusion is relatively unknown because the typical patient has many comorbidities; this makes it difficult to separate the symptoms of mirrored-self misidentification from other existing psychological conditions. Furthermore, a standard neurological or neuropsychological workup tends to overlook the existence of this delusion because affected patients have extensive cognitive degeneration that is the main focus of medical attention. As such, it can be incumbent upon the patient's family to recognize symptoms of the delusion, mainly that the patient is unable to recognize him or herself in the mirror but has an intact ability to recognize the reflections of others.",0
1021,"El Airo is a village located in the southern part of Ecuador's Loja province known for growing some of the best coffee in Ecuador. It is in the northwestern part of the Espindola canton about 25 km from Amaluza, the 
canton's capital. History
The village of El Airo's name originates from the time of the ""Patrones"" or moneyed landowners, who named their hacienda El Airo due to the strong winds that existed in the area as well as its high elevation.
The highest parts of El Airo are near the presumed location of the Inca Trail through Southern Ecuador. This assumption along with the rudimentary stone tools and structure foundations that have been found in El Airo suggest that the first inhabitants of the area now known as El Airo were indigenous in origin.
For a large part of the 20th century El Airo existed as a hacienda with the majority of the mixed race population working the patrones' land in exchange for a small subsistence plot of their own. In the 1960s Ecuador enacted agricultural land reform which led to the majority population of El Airo gaining land and freedom from the authority of the patrón. It was at this time that the patrones left El Airo.",0

Colossae was located on the north side of the Hellespont (Bosphorus), opposite the island of Lesbos. The city was built on a promontory that formed the northeasternmost point of the mainland. It was situated on a narrow isthmus between two deep gorges, which are now crossed by the Araz and Çoruh rivers. The site is located approximately halfway between present-day Selçuk and Izmir.

Colossae was founded around 600 BC by colonists from Miletus in an attempt to secure a safe seaport on the eastern coast of Anatolia. The city grew rapidly, became an important commercial center, and was able to support a population of over 10,000 citizens. Colossae was conquered by the Persian satrap Artaxerxes II in 405 BC, but it maintained its independence until it was captured by Alexander the Great in 334 BC. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Colossae became part of his empire and remained an important city until it was destroyed by an earthquake in 262 BC.

1027,"The Ugaritic writing system is a cuneiform abjad (consonantal alphabet) used from around either the fifteenth century BCE or 1300 BCE for Ugaritic, an extinct Northwest Semitic language, and discovered in Ugarit (modern Ras Al Shamra), Syria, in 1928. It has 30 letters. Other languages (particularly Hurrian) were occasionally written in the Ugaritic script in the area around Ugarit, although not elsewhere. Clay tablets written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the North Semitic and South Semitic orders of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic orders of the reduced Phoenician Writing System and its descendants (including the Paleo-Hebrew aleph-bet, Hebrew, Syriac, Greek and Latin) on the one hand, and of the Ge'ez alphabet on the other which was also influenced by the ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic writing system, and adapted for Amharic. The Arabic and Ancient South Arabian scripts are the only other Semitic alphabets which have letters for all or almost all of the 29 commonly reconstructed proto-Semitic consonant phonemes. (But note that several of these distinctions were only secondarily added to the Arabic alphabet by means of diacritic dots.) According to Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz in Handbook of Ugaritic Studies (eds. Wilfred G.E. Watson and Nicholas Wyatt, 1999): ""The language they [the 30 signs] represented could be described as an idiom which in terms of content seemed to be comparable to Canaanite texts, but from a phonological perspective, however, was more like Arabic"" (82, 89, 614).",0
1028,"From the 4th century BC on, new types of oared warships appeared in the Mediterranean Sea, superseding the trireme and transforming naval warfare. Ships became increasingly large and heavy, including some of the largest wooden ships hitherto constructed. These developments were spearheaded in the Hellenistic Near East, but also to a large extent shared by the naval powers of the Western Mediterranean, specifically Carthage and the Roman Republic. While the wealthy successor kingdoms in the East built huge warships (""polyremes""), Carthage and Rome, in the intense naval antagonism during the Punic Wars, relied mostly on medium-sized vessels. At the same time, smaller naval powers employed an array of small and fast craft, which were also used by the ubiquitous pirates. Following the establishment of complete Roman hegemony in the Mediterranean after the Battle of Actium, the nascent Roman Empire faced no major naval threats. In the 1st century AD, the larger warships were retained only as flagships and were gradually supplanted by the light liburnians until, by Late Antiquity, the knowledge of their construction had been lost. Terminology
Most of the warships of the era were distinguished by their names, which were compounds of a number and a suffix. Thus the English term quinquereme derives from Latin  and has the Greek equivalent  . Both are compounds featuring a prefix meaning ""five"": Latin , ancient Greek  . The Roman suffix is from , ""oar"": hence ""five-oar"". As the vessel cannot have had only five oars, the word must be a figure of speech meaning something else. There are a number of possibilities. The -ηρης occurs only in suffix form, deriving from  , ""(I) row"". As ""rower"" is   and ""oar"" is  , -ērēs does not mean either of those but, being based on the verb, must mean ""rowing"". This meaning is no clearer than the Latin. Whatever the ""five-oar"" or the ""five-row"" originally meant was lost with knowledge of the construction, and is, from the 5th century on, a hotly debated issue. For the history of the interpretation efforts and current scholarly consensus, see below.",0

Owners rejected this proposal as too costly for the league.

Leadbeater played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a middle-order batsman from 1966 to 1979, although he preferred to open the innings. His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century. The highlight of his playing career was a man-of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match in which he was not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury.

1043,"Rutherford scattering is the elastic scattering of particles by nuclei in the presence of a magnetic field. It was discovered by Ernest Rutherford in 1911.

Rutherford scattering is the elastic scattering of particles by nuclei in the presence of a magnetic field. It was discovered by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, and is one of the fundamental processes in nuclear physics. Rutherford scattering takes place when a nucleus is placed in the presence of a strong magnetic field, and the scattered particles are deflected by the field. The deflection can be measured as the angle at which the scattered particles travel after being released from the nucleus.

Rutherford scattering is important for understanding the structure and behavior of atomic nuclei. By understanding how Rutherford scattering affects the nucleus, scientists can determine properties such as the number and size of nucleons, as well as nuclear reactions. Rutherford scattering is also used to study materials that are magnetically sensitive, such as metals.",1

1047,"Adaptive resonance theory (ART) is a theory that explains how a resonance between two or more oscillators can lead to the emergence of new, unusual behaviors.

ART was first proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, and it has since become one of the most widely accepted theories of chaotic behavior. The theory states that when two or more oscillators are in resonance, their frequencies will begin to interact and create new frequencies that are not present either of the individual oscillators. This process can lead to the emergence of new patterns and behaviors that are not possible with either of the individual oscillators alone.

ART is often used to explain complex systems, such as weather patterns or financial markets, and its influence can be seen in a wide variety of fields, from physics to mathematics. Its popularity has led to it being applied to a wide variety of phenomena, from chaos theory to musicology.

Despite its widespread acceptance, there is still much that is unknown about ART, and future research is expected to shed new light on this fascinating theory.",1

Lee led his army south from Richmond, Virginia, to invade the Union states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Despite numerical superiority and years of training, the Union army was unprepared for the Confederate onslaught.

Jackson's strategy was to encircle and destroy the Union army before it could be reinforced. He achieved this by moving his men rapidly through the rugged Shenandoah Valley, where his tactics of hit-and-run attacks and surprise raiding inflicted heavy casualties on the Union forces. On June 15, 1862, at the Battle of Cross Keys, Jackson's forces inflicted a shattering defeat on a numerically superior Union force.

The campaign culminated in Jackson's victory at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1–3, 1863.

Tell's defiance and tyrannicide encouraged the population to open rebellion and a pact against the foreign rulers with neighbouring Schwyz and Unterwalden, marking the foundation of the Swiss Confederacy.

It is considered to constitute one of two genera in the extinct family Sylviornithidae, alongside Megavitiornis from Fiji, which are related to the Galliformes, the group containing the turkeys, chickens, quails and pheasants. Sylviornis was never encountered alive by scientists, but it is known from many thousands of subfossil bones found in deposits, some of them from the Holocene, on New Caledonia and the adjacent Île des Pins.

Sylviornis was a huge flightless bird,  long altogether, and weighing around  on average. It is the most massive galliform known to have ever existed. It had a large skull with a high and laterally compressed beak surmounted by a bony knob. Its legs were rather short, but had strong toes with long nails. The skeleton has a number of peculiarities and differences that make Sylviornis stand apart from all other known birds: the clavicles were not fused to a furcula, the number of caudal vertebrae was very high, and the ribcage and pelvis were almost dinosaurian in appearance. The wings were reduced to small stubs.",0

1100,"Italian Damone is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Italy.  It belongs to the draughts (checkers) family, and it is specifically a diagonal checkers variant.  Each player's pieces are initially placed on two opposite corners of the board and move towards the opposite corner with the possibility of promotion for most of its pieces.  The flow of the game is generally between these two opposite corners hence the diagonality of the game.  Each player only has eight pieces to start the game, which is relatively small compared to most checker variants.  Unlike the undifferentiated pieces as found in most checker variants at the beginning of the game, the pieces in Italian Damone are already differentiated by rank.  The pieces are ranked from high to low as Damone, Damas, and Pedine.  The Damone is sometimes referred to as Imperatore.  The standard game has 1 Damone, 2 Damas, and 5 Pedines for each player.  A player's piece can only capture an opposing piece if the opposing piece is the same rank or lower; therefore, it cannot capture a higher ranked piece.

The apparent shift in its frequency, consistent with the Doppler effect, was suggested to be inconsistent with what would be caused by the movement of Proxima b, a planet of Proxima Centauri. The Doppler shift in the signal was the opposite of what would be expected from the Earth's spin, in that the signal was observed to increase in frequency rather than decrease. Although the signal was detected by Parkes Radio Telescope during observations of Proxima Centauri, due to the beam angle of Parkes Radio telescope, the signal would be more accurately described as having come from within a circle roughly 16 arcminutes (approximately 1/4 of a degree, half the angular width of Earth's moon) in angular diameter, containing Proxima Centauri.

However, some sources suggest that slavery was likely to have been a widespread institution in ancient India by the lifetime of the Buddha (sixth century BCE), and perhaps even as far back as the Vedic period. Slavery in India escalated during the Muslim domination of northern India after the 11th-century, after Muslim rulers re-introduced slavery to the Indian subcontinent. It became a predominant social institution with the enslavement of Hindus, along with the use of slaves in armies for conquest, a long-standing practice within Muslim kingdoms at the time.

This sparked a lively debate in the Christian monthly magazine Crusade between David Sheppard, later Bishop of Liverpool, and John Pridmore. The debate inspired the editor of Crusade, John Capon, to launch Third Way as a fortnightly magazine in January 1977, putting a Christian perspective on current affairs and the arts. Its title refers to an observation by the theologian Os Guinness in his 1973 book The Dust of Death: 'How often in the contemporary discussion a sensitive modern man knows that he cannot accept either of the polarised alternatives offered to him. In Christianity, however, there can be a Third Way, a true middle ground which has a basis, is never compromise and is far from silent.' Third Way's first editor was Derek Williams. In 1978, he was succeeded by Alex Beale, later Alex Mitchell, who moved the magazine to its current monthly publication schedule.",0

In their designs, they emphasize controlled directivity to minimize the effect of room reflections on sound quality. They call this principle uniformly directive diffusion. The company's signature design approach is the use of specific waveguide and very low crossover point (audio crossover). The low crossover point (at 1600 Hz) puts it outside the human's most critical hearing range (between 2000 and 5000 Hz) which makes the crossover between the tweeter and woofer undistinguishable. Waveguide is also used to align the drivers timewise and unify their dispersion throughout a wide frequency band.

The institute's name comes from the Greek word  eleutheros, meaning ""freedom and equality."" The school admitted students without regard to ethnicity or gender, including freed and fugitive slaves. Its first classes began offering secondary school instruction on November 27, 1848. The school was renamed Eleutherian College in 1854, when it began offering college-level coursework. It is the second college in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains and the first in Indiana to provide interracial education. The restored three-story stone chapel and classroom building was constructed between 1853 and 1856 and presently serves as a local history museum. In the decade before the American Civil War, African-American students comprised approximately one quarter to one third of the institute's total enrollment, with its peak years between 1855 and 1861. At one time during this period its enrollment reached 150 students; however, attendance soon declined and no black students were enrolled at the school after 1861. During the Civil War the college's grounds were used for military training and its main building were used for meetings and concerts. The college closed in 1874, but the main building was used as a private high school and teachers' training school until 1887, when the Lancaster township trustees purchased the building for use as a public school, which closed in 1938. Historic Madison, a Jefferson County preservation organization, received the school as a gift in 1973 and sold it to its present owners in 1990.

1141,"Tycho Brahe ( ; born Tyge Ottesen Brahe; 14 December 154624 October 1601) was a Danish astronomer, known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical observations. Born in Scania, which became part of Sweden in the next century, Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He has been described as ""the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact empirical facts"". Most of his observations were more accurate than the best observations available at the time. An heir to several of Denmark's principal noble families, Tycho received a comprehensive education. He took an interest in astronomy and in the creation of more accurate instruments of measurement. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of Copernican heliocentrism with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system. His system correctly saw the Moon as orbiting Earth, and the planets as orbiting the Sun, but improperly considered the Sun to be orbiting the Earth. Furthermore, he was the last of the major astronomers to work without telescopes. In his De nova stella (On the New Star) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm. His precise measurements indicated that ""new stars"" (stellae novae, now called supernovae), in particular that of 1572 (SN 1572), lacked the parallax expected in sublunar phenomena and were therefore not tail-less comets in the atmosphere, as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and beyond the Moon. Using similar measurements, he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly immutable celestial spheres.",0

1145,"A racing slick or slick tyre is a type of tyre that has a smooth tread used mostly in auto racing. The first production slick tyre was developed by M&H Tires in the early 1950s for use in drag racing. By eliminating any grooves cut into the tread, such tyres provide the largest possible contact patch to the road, and maximize dry traction for any given tyre dimension; see Performance. Slick tyres are used on race tracks and in road racing, where acceleration, steering and braking require maximum traction from each wheel. Slick tyres are typically used on only the driven (powered) wheels in drag racing, where the only concern is maximum traction to put power to the ground, and are not used in rallying. Slick tyres are not suitable for use on common road vehicles, which must be able to operate in all weather conditions. They are used in auto racing where competitors can choose different tyres based on the weather conditions and can often change tyres during a race.",0

1169,"A bill of materials or product structure (sometimes bill of material, BOM or associated list) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners or confined to a single manufacturing plant. A bill of materials is often tied to a production order whose issuance may generate reservations for components in the bill of materials that are in stock and requisitions for components that are not in stock. There are two types of bill materials. A BOM can define products as they are designed (engineering bill of materials), as they are ordered (sales bill of materials), as they are built (manufacturing bill of materials), or as they are maintained (service bill of materials). The different types depend on the business need and use for which they are intended. In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list. The phrase ""bill of material"" (or ""BOM"") is frequently used by engineers attributively to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test.",0

The region was also variously known as Gallia, Arbuna or Narbonensis. Septimania territory roughly corresponds with the modern French former administrative region of Languedoc-Roussillon that merged into the new administrative region of Occitanie. Septimania was conquered by the Muslims in the 8th century, when it was known as Arbuna and was made part of Al-Andalus. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba, which had been expanding from the south during the eighth century, before its subsequent conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (Marca Gothica). Septimania became a march of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia down to the thirteenth century, though it was culturally and politically autonomous from the northern France-based central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from the count territories of Toulouse, Provence, and ancient County of Barcelona. It was part of the wider cultural and linguistic region comprising the southern third of France known as Occitania.

1207,"A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1929–1930 at the University of California, Berkeley, and patented in 1932. A cyclotron accelerates charged particles outwards from the center of a flat cylindrical vacuum chamber along a spiral path. The particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying electric field. Lawrence was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for this invention. The cyclotron was the first ""cyclical"" accelerator. In existing electrostatic accelerators of the time, such as the Cockcroft–Walton accelerator and Van de Graaff generator, particles would cross an accelerating electric field only once.  Thus, the energy gained by the particles was limited by the maximum electrical potential that could be achieved across the accelerating region. This was in turn limited by electrostatic breakdown to a few million volts. In a cyclotron, by contrast, the particles encounter the accelerating region many times by following a spiral path, so the output energy can be many times the energy gained in a single accelerating step.",0

1245,"The Fender Stratocaster, colloquially known as the Strat, is a model of electric guitar designed from 1952 into 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton and Freddie Tavares. The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster since 1954. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top ""horn"" shape for balance. Along with the Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes. ""Stratocaster"" and ""Strat"" are trademark terms belonging to Fender. Guitars that duplicate the Stratocaster by other manufacturers are sometimes called S-Type or ST-type guitars. The guitar introduced into the popular market several features that were innovative for electric guitars in the mid-1950s.  The distinctive body shape, which has become commonplace among electric guitars, was revolutionary for the time period, and for the first time a mass-market electric guitar did not significantly resemble earlier acoustic models.  The double cutaway, elongated horns, and heavily contoured back were all designed for better balance and comfort to play while standing up and slung off the shoulder with a strap.  The three-pickup design offered players increased versatility and choice in tone quality over earlier one- and two-pickup electric guitars, and a responsive and simplified vibrato arm integrated into the bridge plate, which marked a significant design improvement over other vibrato systems, such as those manufactured by Bigsby.  All of these design elements were popularized and later became an industry standard due to the success of the Stratocaster.",0

1248,"Phallus hadriani, commonly known as the dune stinkhorn or the sand stinkhorn, is a species of fungus in the Phallaceae (stinkhorn) family. It is a widely distributed species, and is native to Asia, Europe, and North America. In Australia, it is probably an introduced species. The stalk of the fruit body reaches up to  tall by  thick, and is spongy, fragile, and hollow. At the top of the stem is a ridged and pitted, thimble-like cap over which is spread olive-colored spore slime (gleba). Shortly after emerging, the gleba liquefies and releases a fetid odor that attracts insects, which help disperse the spores. Said to be edible in its immature egg-like stage, it typically grows in public lawns, yards and gardens, usually in sandy soils. Phallus hadriani may be distinguished from the similar P. impudicus (the common stinkhorn) by the presence of a pink or violet-colored volva at the base of the stem, and by differences in odor. Taxonomy
The species was first described scientifically by the French botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat in 1798, and sanctioned by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon under that name in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck called the species Hymenophallus hadriani in 1817; this name is a synonym. According to the taxonomical database Index Fungorum, additional synonyms include: Phallus iosmus, named by Berkeley in 1836; Phallus imperialis, Schulzer, 1873; Ithyphallus impudicus var. imperialis and Ithyphallus impudicus var. iosmos, De Toni, date unknown.",0

1250,"A field-replaceable unit (FRU) is a printed circuit board, part, or assembly that can be quickly and easily removed from a computer or other piece of electronic equipment, and replaced by the user or a technician without having to send the entire product or system to a repair facility. FRUs allow a technician lacking in-depth product knowledge to isolate faults and replace faulty components. The granularity of FRUs in a system impacts total cost of ownership and support, including the costs of stocking spare parts, where spares are deployed to meet repair time goals, how diagnostic tools are designed and implemented, levels of training for field personnel, whether end-users can do their own FRU replacement, etc. Other equipment
FRUs are not strictly confined to computers but are also part of many high-end, lower-volume consumer and commercial products.

1254,"A transcriptional activator is a protein (transcription factor) that increases transcription of a gene or set of genes. Activators are considered to have positive control over gene expression, as they function to promote gene transcription and, in some cases, are required for the transcription of genes to occur. Most activators are DNA-binding proteins that bind to enhancers or promoter-proximal elements. The DNA site bound by the activator is referred to as an ""activator-binding site"". The part of the activator that makes protein–protein interactions with the general transcription machinery is referred to as an ""activating region"" or ""activation domain"". Most activators function by binding sequence-specifically to a regulatory DNA site located near a promoter and making protein–protein interactions with the general transcription machinery (RNA polymerase and general transcription factors), thereby facilitating the binding of the general transcription machinery to the promoter. Other activators help promote gene transcription by triggering RNA polymerase to release from the promoter and proceed along the DNA. At times, RNA polymerase can pause shortly after leaving the promoter; activators also function to allow these “stalled” RNA polymerases to continue transcription.",0

1278,"Vascular corrosion casting uses resin to capture the 3D structure of blood vessels within human and animal tissue. It is widely used in research as a technique for obtaining the volume and surface area of the blood vessel network within an organ. The earliest known use of corrosion casting was by Robert Boyle in 1663. Technique
Vascular corrosion casting requires the use of a solidifying material such as a resin. The most common resin used for vascular corrosion casting is Batson's 17. The process begins with the draining of blood from vessels to prevent blockage from clotting, this can be achieved by perfusing blood vessels with a physiological fluid such as phosphate buffered saline. Subsequently, the blood vessels of interest are filled with resin (or alternative solidifying material). The resin is allowed to cure resulting in the blood vessel network containing a solid plastic material. Surrounding tissue is dissolved away using a corrosive chemical, commonly potassium hydroxide. Corrosion should not affect the resin, only dissolving tissue. The final product is a 3D network of blood vessels.",0

1289,"Volleyballene term refers to a chemical compound that is a new type of 3D hollow molecule composed of carbon and transition metals, the name is a reference to fullerenes. It is the first buckyball compound to be spiked with scandium atoms. The main feature of these substances is that metal atoms are part of the framework and they are not deposited on the surface of the molecule. The incorporation of the metal atoms avoids their clustering and confers to volleyballene with sites to attach hydrogen mainly. The history of volleyballenes dates from its first prediction in 2016 by Jing Wang et al. A further study based on Density functional Theory (DFT) carried out by Tlahuice-Flores in the same year supports the prediction and provides with Infrared, Raman and UV spectra of the structure for its experimental detection. The structure is described as one Sc8 cluster holding 12 scandium atoms linked to six C10 units on each face. The chemical formula C60Sc20 is close related to C80 fullerene and it has a large HOMO-LUMO gap of 1.47 eV. Further hydrogenation of volleyballene reported a 70-H structure with an adsorption energy of circa -0.11 eV/H2. Moreover, it is expected that the adsorption-desorption reaction can be reached at ambient temperature. Potential use of volleyballenes is hydrogen storage even at ambient conditions. References ",0

Henry was a younger son of Eustace de Balliol and Petronilla FitzPiers.  Although invited by King John of England to take his side shortly before the time of Magna Carta, it is probable that he, like his sovereign Alexander II, joined the party of the barons. He is mentioned in the Scottish records in the years between 1223 and 1244, and the appointment of Sir John Maxwell of Caerlaverock, who appears as Lord Chamberlain of Scotland in 1231, must either have been temporary, or Baliol must have retained the title after demitting the office, which George Crawfurd supposes him to have done in 1231.

Governors Island was acquired by the City of New York in 1898 from the private owners, who had acquired it in 1785 as a private hunting ground. The island was used as a military reservation during the American Revolutionary War, and later served as a quarantine station for ship passengers arriving from European ports. In 1898, it became part of the newly created City of New York. Since the late 20th century, Governors Island has been used as an athletic training ground by the New York Mets and New York Giants.

The first European to explore the island was Henry Hudson in 1609, who named it ""Island of Horses"". The Dutch claimed it in 1624 and renamed it ""Nieuw Amsterdam"". In 1664, King Charles II granted the island to Sir Edmund Andros, governor of New Netherland; Andros later bequeathed it to his son-in-law, Peter Stuyvesant.

Since 1993, the village has just one lifeboat station on the southern side of Flamborough Head. The station operates an ILB (Inshore Lifeboat). History
A north station at Flamborough was built in 1871 as No. 1 station, Flamborough. No. 2 site was built in the same year, but closed in 1938. Both sites were opened after the Great Gale of 1871 when many ships were wrecked along the east coast of England. As the coastline at Flamborough Head juts out for  into the North Sea, having two sites on either side of the Head would mean that from wherever the wind was blowing in bad weather, at least one of the lifeboats could be launched. A slipway was added to the No. 1 site in 1890, but ultimately, the two Flamborough sites were amalgamated into one on the northern site in the 1930s. Both sites used skids and poles to aid the launching of the lifeboats into the water, and in 1934, when the No. 1 lifeboathouse was enlarged for the Elizabeth and Albina Whitley, a turntable was also added at the top to aid recovery of the vessel.",0

It was first described by Frederick Smith in 1854 who found the species in what is now the island of Sri Lanka. Many older references erroneously placed this species in Melipona, an unrelated genus from the New World, and until recently it was placed in Trigona, therefore still often mistakenly referred to as Trigona iridipennis. For centuries, colonies of T. iridipennis have been kept in objects such as clay pots so that their highly prized medicinal honey can be utilized. Taxonomy and phylogenetics 
Tetragonula iridipennis belongs to the complex genus of stingless bees Tetragonula which contains more than 30 described species from the Indian subcontinent. Until recently, all species in the group were treated as belonging to the single genus ""Trigona"". Tetragonula iridipennis belongs to the smaller Iridipennis species group which includes four primary species: Tetragonula iridipennis, Tetragonula praeterita, Tetragonula ruficornis, and Tetragonula bengalensis. These four species were proposed in the 19th century and were poorly characterized. They have since not been directly compared via molecular studies; therefore there is uncertainty about whether they are in fact separate species.",0

1323,"The Álfablót or the Elven sacrifice is a pagan Scandinavian sacrifice to the elves towards the end of autumn, when the crops had been harvested and the animals were most fat. Unlike the great blóts at Uppsala and Mære, the álfablót was a local celebration at the homesteads that was mainly administered by the woman of the household. Nothing is known about the particular rites because they were surrounded by secrecy and strangers were not welcome to the homesteads during the celebrations. However, since the elves were collective powers with a close connection to ancestors and fertility, it is possible that the álfablót concerned ancestor worship and the life force of the family. It also appears that Odin was implied and that the master of the household was called Ölvir when administering the rites. The first element of Ölvir means ""beer"", which was an important element in Norse pagan sacrifices generally.

A prominent landmark in 18th century London, it stood in the Whitechapel Road beside the newly constructed London Hospital,  being not only older, but significantly taller. It was crossed by tracks, served as a scenic viewing-point (and a hiding place for stolen goods), could be ascended by horses and carts, and supported some trees and formal dwelling-houses.  It has been interpreted as: a defensive fortification in the English Civil War; a burial place for victims of the Great Plague; rubble from the Great Fire of London; and as a laystall (hence it was sometimes called Whitechapel Dunghill).  Possibly all of these theories are true to some extent. Whitechapel Mount was physically removed around 1807.  Because Londoners widely believed in the ""Great Fire rubble"" theory, the remains were sifted by antique hunters, and some sensational finds were claimed.  It survives in its present-day placename Mount Terrace, E1.",0

Let X be a topological space, and let  be an open cover of X. Let  denote the nerve of the covering. The idea of Čech cohomology is that, for an open cover  consisting of sufficiently small open sets, the resulting simplicial complex  should be a good combinatorial model for the space X. For such a cover, the Čech cohomology of X is defined to be the simplicial cohomology of the nerve. This idea can be formalized by the notion of a good cover. However, a more general approach is to take the direct limit of the cohomology groups of the nerve over the system of all possible open covers of X, ordered by refinement. This is the approach adopted below.",0

The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfur's non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.

Roughly one mile long, the road links the Inner Harbour of Cardiff Bay to Cardiff city centre and forms part of the A470 road. It runs parallel to Bute Street and the Butetown Branch Line.  Landscaping on the route was completed in 2000, and it was renamed after the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George.
The site of the avenue had been known as Collingdon Road, which was described as a ""grimy industrial area of small factories and workshops, employing hundreds of people"". The original concept, a scheme by Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC), envisaged the removal of the railway line along Bute Street to create a continental-style boulevard, initially named Bute Avenue, with a Light Rapid Transit system, a park and recreational facilities. The Welsh Office required the CDBC to use the Private Finance Initiative to construct Bute Avenue. Due to high costs, the LRT element of the project was abandoned, but a new road was built as part of a £120 million PFI scheme awarded to a consortium of investors and shareholders named City Link. After the wind-up of the CBDC in March 2000, all property rights and liabilities for the Bute Avenue project transferred to the Welsh Development Agency.",0
1363,"In recruitment, the multiple mini-interview (MMI) is an interview format in which a number of job candidates are asked to take part in a series of short interviews. The aim is to assess the potential of each candidate and to compare and contrast their skills and qualifications.

Multiple mini-interviews are often used in recruitment processes where the number of job applications received is too great to be assessed individually. They are also popular in situations where the company needs to make a quick decision about who to interview.

The multiple mini-interview is usually conducted in a group setting, with a number of candidates being interviewed at the same time. This allows the interviewer to get a broad overview of each candidate's skills and qualifications.

There are a number of benefits to using the multiple mini-interview format in recruitment. Firstly, it can help to reduce the time taken to assess candidates. Secondly, it can help to identify any potential conflicts or gaps in candidates' skills and experience. Finally, it can help to ensure that all candidates are given an equal opportunity to be interviewed.",1

1370,"Replica cluster move in condensed matter physics refers to a family of non-local cluster algorithms used to simulate spin glasses. It is an extension of the Swendsen-Wang algorithm in that it generates non-trivial spin clusters informed by the interaction states on two (or more) replicas instead of just one. It is different from the replica exchange method (or parallel tempering), as it performs a non-local update on a fraction of the sites between the two replicas at the same temperature, while parallel tempering directly exchanges all the spins between two replicas at different temperature.

Lucas is particularly well known for his activism and outspokenness on a variety of issues in LGBT and Jewish cultures. Hezbollah's attacks in the 2006 Lebanon war stirred Lucas to go to Israel to entertain gay soldiers who are allowed to serve openly in the military.

1381,"Sigismondo d'India (c. 1582 – before 19 April 1629) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He was one of the most accomplished contemporaries of Monteverdi, and wrote music in many of the same forms as the more famous composer. Life
D'India was probably born in Palermo, Sicily in 1582, though details of his life are lacking until around 1600.  During the first decade of the 17th century he probably traveled widely in Italy, meeting composers, acquiring patrons at various aristocratic courts, and absorbing the musical styles at each locale.  This was a time of transition in music history, as the polyphonic style of the late Renaissance was giving way to the widely diverse practices of the early Baroque, and d'India seems to have acquired an unusually broad grasp of the total stylistic practice in Italy: the expressive madrigal style of Marenzio, the grand polychoral work of the Venetian School, the conservative polyphonic tradition of the Roman School, the attempts to recover the music of the ancient world in monody and its larger vehicle, the newly developing opera, as well as the mannered, emotionally intense chromatic style of Carlo Gesualdo in Naples.  D'India is known to have been in Florence, the birthplace of opera, as well as Mantua, where Monteverdi was working.  In Naples he probably met Gesualdo, and by 1610 he was in Parma and Piacenza.  The next year, 1611, he was hired by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to direct music in Turin, where he remained until 1623; these were the most productive years of his life, during which he amalgamated the disparate types of music he had heard and absorbed during the years 1600–1610 into a unified style.",0

Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but Amazing helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction. As of 2018, Amazing has been published, with some interruptions, for 92 years, going through a half-dozen owners and many editors as it struggled to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and lost control of the magazine in 1929. In 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly before the end of the pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo Award three times during his tenure in the 1970s.

1394,"The Craigville Historic District encompasses a historic religious camp meeting area in the Craigville section of Barnstable, Massachusetts.  It is centered on the junction of Lake Elizabeth Drive and Ocean Avenue, just west of Lake Elizabeth.  The camp meeting was established in 1871 by the New England Convention of Christian Churches on land that was purchased from members of the Perry family.  Along the grid of roads south of the main junction, gingerbread-decorated Gothic cottages were built over the following decades.  The main tabernacle, an open-walled church, was built in 1887.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history
Craigville is located in southern Barnstable, between the villages of Centerville and Hyannisport.  The historic district encompasses the original core of a religious camp meeting area established in 1871 on what was before then called ""Strawberry Hill"" and became known thereafter as ""Christian Hill"".  Originally called ""Camp Christian"", the area quickly developed, with a store and post office (both built 1872-73), and an inn (1874).  It was renamed Craigville in 1881 after the death of Dr. J. Austin Craig.  The camp's central feature, its tabernacle, was originally a large tent with a capacity of 600 worshippers, which assumed its more permanent framing and elements in 1887.  The area around the tabernacle was subdivided into small parcels, on which campers erected temporary, and eventually permanent structures.  This pattern of development was similar to camp meetings established earlier, including ones at Yarmouth and Martha's Vineyard.",0

1396,"Hagano was a petty nobleman (mediocris) who achieved influence in Lotharingia and West Francia during the rule of Charles the Simple (898–922). He was a relative of Charles' first wife, Frederuna, and was originally from Lotharingia. Though Frederuna had died in 917, by 918 Hagano had become the king's favourite and his most trusted advisor. The aristocracy despised him, however, and the authority of Charles over the nobles was severely weakened by Hagano's presence at court. Charles' sin appears to be transferring grants in benefice, especially of monasteries, from his barons to Hagano.  In 919, the West Frankish barons refused to assist the king in repelling a Magyar invasion. One of the leading Lotharingian barons, Gilbert, threw his support behind Henry the Fowler, the German king, and, according to Flodoard, was elected ""prince"" (princeps) by the Lotharingian aristocracy. Flodoard also records that Robert of Neustria made a treaty with the Vikings without royal permission. When, in 922, Charles granted Hagano Chelles, at that time already held by Rothilde, a daughter of Charles the Bald, the barons of West Francia revolted and made Robert king in Charles' place. ",0

1398,"Cationic liposomes are spherical structures that contain positively charged lipids. Cationic liposomes can vary in size between 40 nm and 500 nm, and they can either have one lipid bilayer (monolamellar) or multiple lipid bilayers (multilamellar). The positive charge of the phospholipids allows cationic liposomes to form complexes with negatively charged nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, and siRNA) through ionic interactions. Upon interacting with nucleic acids, cationic liposomes form clusters of aggregated vesicles. These interactions allows cationic liposomes to condense and encapsulate various therapeutic and diagnostic agents in their aqueous compartment or in their lipid bilayer. These cationic liposome-nucleic acid complexes are also referred to as lipoplexes. Due to the overall positive charge of cationic liposomes, they interact with negatively charged cell membranes more readily than classic liposomes. This positive charge can also create some issues in vivo, such as binding to plasma proteins in the bloodstream, which leads to opsonization. These issues can be reduced by optimizing the physical and chemical properties of cationic liposomes through their lipid composition. Cationic liposomes are increasingly being researched for use as delivery vectors in gene therapy due to their capability to efficiently transfect cells. A common application for cationic liposomes is cancer drug delivery. History 
In the 1960s, Alec D. Bangham discovered liposomes as concentric lipid bilayers surrounding an aqueous center, based on his research at the University of Cambridge Babraham Institute. The first formulations were designed using all natural lipids. In 1987, Philip Felgner published the first approach to using cationic lipids to transfect DNA into cells, based on his research into cationic lipids at Syntex from 1982 to 1988. Felgner introduced the first cationic lipid used for gene delivery, N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA).",0

1400,"Necrotizing pneumonia (NP), also known as cavitary necrotizing pneumonia (CNCP), is a serious lung infection caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It most commonly affects people who are severely ill or have compromised immune systems, and is rapidly fatal in almost all cases. NP is considered a life-threatening infection, with a mortality rate of up to 95%.

NP is a highly destructive infection of the lungs that can quickly lead to death. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of NP, and the illness typically affects people who are very sick or have a weakened immune system. NP typically begins with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever. Within days, the infection can spread to the lungs, and patients may develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) and fluid accumulation in the lungs. NP is often fatal within a few weeks, but there is some hope for those who survive. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to fight the bacteria, and supportive care such as breathing assistance and hydration. In very rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue from the lungs.",1

Zemah's father, Paltoi ben Abaye, was the Pumbedita Gaon from 841-858, an office which Zemah served himself, after the death of the previous Gaon, Abba ben Ammi. Zemah is most noted for his compilation of the first Talmudic dictionary, the Arukh, a work listing some 300 Aramaic terms, as well as a list of names and places recorded in the Babylonian Talmud. His work became the model on which two later works were based: one compiled under the same name in 1101 CE, by R. Nathan ben Jehiel of Rome, and another, a Judeo-Arabic lexicon, compiled by David ben Abraham al-Fasi nearly one-hundred years earlier, and which work elucidates difficult words in the Hebrew Bible. Zemah ben Paltoi's Arukh was in response to a query addressed to him about obscure Aramaic words found in the Talmud. The entries of his lexicon were arranged in alphabetical order, but the work is no longer extant. Excerpts of the work are quoted by Abraham Zacuto in his Sefer Yuchasin. Some of Zemah ben Paltoi's extant responsa concern a man who died in Kairouan and whose heirs were living in Spain, and another concerning a woman whose Ketubbah (marriage contract) had been lost. Zemah ben Paltoi was an ancestor of Rabbi Hai Gaon, from Hai Gaon's maternal line. He was also the great-grandfather of Sherira Gaon.",0

1427,"Menas of Egypt (also Mina, Minas, Mena, Menes, Menes II) was a pharaoh of the First Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He was probably the son of King Khufu and Queen Meritites I. Menas is considered to be the first king of the 1st dynasty.

Menas is known primarily from a single inscription found at Abydos that describes him as the son of Khufu and Queen Meritites I. The inscription gives his Horus name as Merenre Nemtyemsaf and gives no further details about his life or reign. The only other contemporary attestations of Menas are a few inscriptions from Semna and Qatna that also mention him as the son of Khufu and Queen Meritites I.

Very little is known about Menas' reign, except that he was a short-lived king who reigned for only a few years during the early First Dynasty. It is possible that he was succeeded by his brother Neferirkare Kakai who may have had a short reign of his own. Menas is not mentioned in any other sources, making it difficult to know more about his reign.",1

In the Stephanus pagination, it spans III. 310b–315a. The Second Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse in response to a supposed complaint  he lodged against Plato and his associates that they were slandering him.  The letter disclaims any responsibility for these slanders and further denies that Plato has even heard of them occurring.  It then counsels Dionysius that a concern for his reputation after his death should incline him to repair his relationship with Plato, since the interactions of political men with the wise is a topic of constant discussion.  From this subject, the letter turns to an enigmatic discussion of ""the First,"" in which Plato warns Dionysius to never write these doctrines down and to burn this letter upon committing its contents to memory.  The Second Letter is the source of the oft-cited remark that ""no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new (καλός καί νέος)"".",0

1433,"Lunar escape systems (LESS) were a series of proposals for human spaceflight to the Moon that were developed by the United States during the 1960s.

Lunar escape systems were a series of proposals for human spaceflight to the Moon that were developed by the United States during the 1960s. The systems would have involved using a spacecraft to launch away from the lunar surface, using either an explosive engine or a rocket assisted lift off (RALO) technique. The proposed systems differed in their methods of reaching escape velocity, with some proposing to use a direct ascent trajectory, while others proposed using a lower orbit.

The first lunar escape system, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), was developed in 1964 and was initially considered to be the most likely option for human spaceflight to the Moon. LOR involved using a spacecraft to rendezvous with the Moon and then use its engines to enter a low orbit around it. The spacecraft would then use its engines to increase its speed and exit the Moon's gravitational field, allowing it to travel to Earth. LOR was eventually abandoned in favour of more advanced proposals, most notably Lunar Transfer Orbit (LTO).

LTO was a proposal for human spaceflight to the Moon that was developed in 1966. LTOinvolved using a spacecraft to launch away from the lunar surface, using either an explosive engine or a RALO technique. The spacecraft would then use its engines to enter a high orbit around the Moon, before using its high speed towards Earth. LTO was eventually",1

In Pagan Theology, York presents his controversial theory that the term ""paganism"", originally a pejorative term to refer to non-Christian religions, should instead be used by scholars to refer specifically to those religious movements who share the common characteristics of polytheism, animism and life-affirming beliefs. Under this category of ""paganism"", York therefore includes the extinct historical faiths of pre-Christian Europe, living indigenous religions, several modern religions like Shinto and Hinduism, and the new religious movements of contemporary Paganism.

The Court held that a student admissions process that favors ""underrepresented minority groups"" does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause so long as it takes into account other factors evaluated on an individual basis for every applicant. The case arose after a prospective student to the University of Michigan Law School alleged that she had been denied admission because the school gave certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission. The school admitted that its admission process favored certain minority groups, but argued that there was a compelling state interest to ensure a ""critical mass"" of students from minority groups.

It is considered synonymous (or nearly synonymous) with the name monocotyledon. Publication of the name is credited to Scopoli (in 1760): see author citation (botany). This name is formed by replacing the termination -aceae in the name Liliaceae by the termination -opsida (Art 16 of the ICBN). Although in principle it is true that circumscription of this class will vary with the taxonomic system being used, in practice this name is very strongly linked to the Cronquist system, and the allied Takhtajan system. These two are the only major systems to use the name, and in both these systems it refers to the group more widely known as the monocotyledons. Earlier systems referred to this group by the name Monocotyledones, with Monocotyledoneae an earlier spelling (these names may be used in any rank).

1458,"Ornithopods  or members of the clade Ornithopoda  are a group of ornithischian dinosaurs that started out as small, bipedal running grazers, and grew in size and numbers until they became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the Cretaceous world, and dominated the North American landscape. Their major evolutionary advantage was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed by a non-avian dinosaur, rivaling that of modern mammals such as the domestic cow. They reached their apex of diversity and ecological dominance in the hadrosaurids (colloquially known as 'duck-bills'), before they were wiped out by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event along with all other non-avian dinosaurs. Members are known from all seven continents, though they are generally rare in the Southern Hemisphere. History of research
In 1870, Thomas Henry Huxley listed Iguanodontidae (coined by Cope a year earlier) as one of his three families of dinosaurs (alongside Megalosauridae and Scelidosauridae), including within it the genera Iguanodon, Hypsilophodon, and Hadrosaurus, in addition to Cetiosaurus and tentatively Stenopelix. The term Ornithopoda was erected by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1881 as part of his then still ongoing investigation of the classification of Dinosauria. It was considered one of the four definite orders of dinosaurs, the others being Theropoda, Sauropoda, and Stegosauria (Hallopoda was considered a possible fifth). He subdivided the order into three families: Camptonotidae, Iguanodontidae, and Hadrosauridae; the former was a new name, whereas the latter two were carried over from the nomenclatures of Huxley and Edward Drinker Cope respectively. Within Camptonotidae he included the European Hypsilophodon and three American taxa he named himself, Camptonotus, Laosaurus, and Nanosaurus. Camptonotus was in 1885 renamed to Camptosaurus, as the original name was pre-occupied by a cricket; the associated family follow suit, becoming Camptosauridae. In Iguanodontidae, only found in Europe, he included Iguanodon and Vectisaurus. In Hadrosauridae, he included Hadrosaurus, Cionodon, and tentatively Agathaumas.",0

Overview 
Coleman argues that the algorithms underlying artificial intelligence could greatly improve the human condition, if the algorithms are carefully based on ethical human values. An ideal artificial intelligence would be ""not a replicated model of our own brains, but an expansion of our lens and our vantage point as to what intelligence, life, meaning, and humanity are and can be.""

Since the late 1980s, other private collections from the site have been described and some limited excavations have been conducted. According to a 2019 article published in the journal PaleoAmerica, analysis of the fluted points now suggest that any Clovis presence was probably less than believed and that most of the early material from the Witt Site indicates an occupation by Western Stemmed Tradition groups.

Background
Occupied between AD 1450 and 1550, it is located in southwestern Ontario in rural Elgin County, near the banks of a tributary of Talbot Creek, approximately 20 km west of St. Thomas, Ontario. Archaeological investigations have indicated the presence at one time of eighteen longhouses of various sizes within the village, with an estimated population of 800-900 people. These native inhabitants were the Attiwandaronk (Attarawandon) Indians, an Iroquoian-speaking people called the Neutrals by the French colonists.

Gambusia contains over 40 species, most of which are principally found in freshwater habitats, though some species may also be found in brackish or saltwater habitats. The type species is the Cuban gambusia, G. punctata. The greatest species richness is in Mexico, Texas, and the Greater Antilles, but species are also found elsewhere in the eastern and southern United States, the Bahamas, Central America, and Colombia. Gambusia species are often called topminnows, or simply gambusias; they are also known as mosquitofish, which, however, refers more specifically to two species, G. affinis and G. holbrooki, which are often introduced into ponds to eat mosquito larvae. As a consequence, they have been introduced widely outside their native range, and frequently become invasive, threatening local species. They are only occasionally kept in aquariums, due to their relative lack of color and the highly aggressive nature of the aforementioned mosquitofish species. Nine species are listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List; one, the widemouth gambusia, G. eurystoma, is critically endangered; and two, the Amistad gambusia, G. amistadensis, and the San Marcos gambusia, G. georgei, are already extinct.",0

1508,"A shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden is a part of a garden where shrubs, mostly flowering species, are thickly planted.  The original shrubberies were mostly sections of large gardens, with one or more paths winding through it, a less-remembered aspect of the English landscape garden with very few original 18th-century examples surviving.  As the fashion spread to smaller gardens, linear shrub borders covered up walls and fences, and were typically underplanted with smaller herbacious flowering plants.  By the late 20th century, shrubs, trees and smaller plants tend to be mixed together in the most visible parts of the garden, hopefully blending successfully.  At the same time, shrubs, especially very large ones, have become part of the woodland garden, mixed in with trees, both native species and imported ornamental varieties.  The word is first recorded by the OED in a letter of 1748 by Henrietta Knight, Lady Luxborough to the fanatical gardener William Shenstone: ""Nature has been so remarkably kind this last Autumn to adorn my Shrubbery with the flowers that usually blow at Whitsuntide"".  The shrubbery developed to display exciting new imported flowering species, initially mostly from the East Coast of British America, and quickly replaced the older formal ""wilderness"", with compartments of smaller trees surrounded by hedges, and little colour.  It was a further part of the garden, beyond the terrace and flower garden that the house usually opened onto, and when mature provided shade on hot days, some shelter from a wind, and some privacy.

During the 1960s, rice was scarce in South Korea, and the government was prompted to promote bunsik as an alternative. Committees were set up in each region to encourage public organizations, schools, and government offices to lead the movement. Restaurants were guided to use more barley and wheat flour while sales of rice-based foods were banned on certain days of the week. Government run restaurants in official buildings were banned from selling rice dishes altogether. This effort lasted until 1976.",0

1525,"Concurrent tandem catalysis (CTC) is a technique in chemistry where multiple catalysts (usually two) produce a product otherwise not accessible by a single catalyst. It is usually practiced as homogeneous catalysis.
Scheme 1 illustrates this process. Molecule A enters this catalytic system to produce the comonomer, B, which along with A enters the next catalytic process to produce the final product, P. This one-pot approach can decrease product loss from isolation or purification of intermediates. Reactions with relatively unstable products can be generated as intermediates because they are only transient species and are immediately used in a consecutive reaction. Introduction
The major advantage of using CTC is it requires a single molecule; however, the required reaction conditions and catalyst compatibility are major hurdles. The system must be thoroughly studied to find the optimal conditions for both the catalysis and reactant to produce the desired product. Occasionally, a trade-off must be made between several competing effects.",0

Significantly, she made the connection that these chemoautotrophic bacteria were able to play this role through their use of chemosynthesis, the biological oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) to synthesize organic matter from very simple carbon-containing molecules, thus allowing organisms such as the bacteria (and dependent organisms such as tube worms) to exist in deep ocean without sunlight.

1541,"A gray horse (or grey horse) has a coat color characterized by progressive depigmentation of the colored hairs of the coat. Most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes; unlike some equine dilution genes and some other genes that lead to depigmentation, gray does not affect skin or eye color. Gray horses may be born any base color, depending on other color genes present.  White hairs begin to appear at or shortly after birth and become progressively more prevalent as the horse ages as white hairs become intermingled with hairs of other colors. Graying can occur at different rates—very quickly on one horse and very slowly on another. As adults, most gray horses eventually become completely white, though some retain intermixed light and dark hairs.  The stages of graying vary widely. Some horses develop a dappled pattern for a period of time, others resemble a roan with more uniform intermixing of light and dark hairs. As they age, some gray horses, particularly those heterozygous for the gray gene, may develop pigmented speckles in addition to a white coat, a pattern colloquially called a “fleabitten gray.” ",0

1566,"In linguistics, wh-movement (also known as wh-fronting, wh-extraction, or wh-raising) is the formation of syntactic dependencies involving interrogative words.

Interrogative forms are known within English linguistics as wh-words, such as what, when, where, who, and why, but also include interrogative words like how. This kind of dependency has been used as a diagnostic tool in syntactic studies as it is subject to a number of interacting grammatical constraints (e.g., island effects, relativized minimality constraints, etc.).  In languages with wh-movement, sentences or clauses with a wh-word show a noncanonical word order that places the wh-word (or phrase containing the wh-word) at or near the front of the sentence or clause (Whom are you thinking about?) instead of the canonical position later in the sentence (I am thinking about you).

1570,"Transnational psychology is a branch of psychology that deals with the study of psychological phenomena that occur beyond the boundaries of one's national or cultural context. It has been suggested that transnational psychology can be seen as a bridge between general and special psychology, or as a new field of study that straddles the boundaries between both traditions.

Transnational psychology is often concerned with understanding how psychological processes and dynamics operate across different cultural contexts, and with exploring the ways in which people's psychological experiences and behaviours are shaped by their social and cultural surroundings. This might involve studying how people cope with differences in culture, or how social networks influence psychological well-being.

1581,"Centrifugal partition chromatography is a special chromatographic technique where both stationary and mobile phase are liquid, and the stationary phase is immobilized by a strong centrifugal force. Centrifugal partition chromatography consists of a series-connected network of extraction cells, which operates as elemental extractors, and the efficiency is guaranteed by the cascade. History 
In the 1940s Craig invented the first apparatus to conduct countercurrent partitioning; he called this Countercurrent Distribution Craig apparatus consists of a series of glass tubes that are designed and arranged such that the lighter liquid phase is transferred from one tube to the next. The next major milestone was Droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC). It uses only gravity to move the mobile phase through the stationary phase which is held in long vertical tubes connected in series. The modern era of CCC began with the development of the planetary centrifuge by Ito which was first introduced in 1966 as a closed helical tube which was rotated on a ""planetary"" axis as is turned on a ""sun"" axis. 
Centrifugal partition chromatography was introduced in Japan in 1982; the first instrument was built at Sanki Eng. Ltd. in Kyoto. The first instrument consisted of twelve cartridges arranged around the rotor of a centrifuge; the inner volume of each cartridge was about 15 mL for 50 channels. In 1999 Kromaton was developed of the first FCPC with Radial Cells. During cell development, the Z cell was completed in 2005 and the twin cell in 2009. In 2017 RotaChrom designed its top performing CPC cells through Computed Fluid Dynamic simulation software. After thousands of simulations, this tool revealed the drawbacks of conventional CPC cell designs and highlighted the unparallel load capacity and scalable cell design of RotaChrom.",0

1597,"Transloading (aka. Cross-Docking) is the process of transferring a shipment from one mode of transportation to another. It is most commonly employed when one mode cannot be used for the entire trip, such as when goods must be shipped internationally from one inland point to another. Such a trip might require transport by truck to an airport, then by airplane overseas, and then by another truck to its destination; or it might involve bulk material (such as coal) loaded to rail at the mine and then transferred to a ship at a port. Transloading is also required at railroad break-of-gauge points, since the equipment can not pass from one track to another unless bogies are exchanged. Since transloading requires handling of the goods, it causes a higher risk of damage. Therefore, transloading facilities are designed with the intent of minimizing handling. Due to differing capacities of the different modes, the facilities typically require some storage facility, such as warehouses or rail yards. For bulk goods, specialized material handling and storage are typically provided (as, for example, in grain elevators). Intermodal transport limits handling by using standardized containers, which are handled as units and which also serve for storage if needed.",0

1600,"Bimetal refers to an object that is composed of two separate metals joined together. Instead of being a mixture of two or more metals, like alloys, bimetallic objects consist of layers of different metals. Trimetal and tetrametal refer to objects composed of three and four separate metals respectively. A bimetal bar is usually made of brass and iron. Bimetallic strips and disks, which convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement, are the most recognized bimetallic objects due to their name. However, there are other common bimetallic objects. For example, tin cans consist of steel covered with tin. The tin prevents the can from rusting. To cut costs and prevent people from melting them down for their metal, coins are often composed of a cheap metal covered with a more expensive metal. For example, the United States penny was changed from 95% copper to 95% zinc, with a thin copper plating to retain its appearance. A common type of trimetallic object (before the all-aluminium can) was a tin-plated steel can with an aluminum lid with a pull tab. Making the lid out of aluminum allowed it to be pulled off by hand instead of using a can opener, but these cans proved difficult to recycle owing to their mix of metals.",0
1601,"""Question authority"" is a popular slogan often used on bumper stickers, T-shirts and as graffiti. The slogan was popularized by controversial psychologist Timothy Leary, although some people have suggested that the idea behind the slogan can be traced back to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. One of the most influential icons in the counterculture movement which formed in the late 1960s out of opposition to the Vietnam War's escalation, Leary gained influence among much of the youth by advocating the use of LSD – which was criminalized in the United States in 1966 –  as a way to escape from the burdens of society.  Following the Watergate Scandal, which resulted in the resignation of US President Richard Nixon and the conviction of several officials in the Nixon administration, the slogan became arguably the most accepted form of ideology among baby boomers. It is intended to encourage people to avoid fallacious appeals to authority.  The term has always symbolized the necessity of paying attention to the rules and regulations promulgated by a government unto its citizenry.  However, psychologists have also criticized Leary's method of questioning authority and have argued that it resulted in widespread dysfunctionality.  In their book Question Authority, Think For Yourself, psychologists Beverly Potter and Mark Estren alleged that the practice of Leary's philosophy enhances a person's self-interest and greatly weakens the ability to cooperate with others.",0

Hungarian railways after World War I were in a poor state. Together with the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, they had lagged behind developments in other countries. By the mid-1930s though, there was a demand for a faster express service. The Hungarian demand was for an express locomotive that would be fast, with a design speed of up to , but owing to the state of the track and also because the running distance and the train weights of 4-5 coach trains were relatively low, it would yet be possible for it to be small and lightweight.

1625,"The Honda Passport is a line of sport utility vehicles (SUV) from the Japanese manufacturer Honda. Originally, it was a badge engineered version of the Isuzu Rodeo, a mid-size SUV sold between 1993 and 2002. It was introduced in 1993 for the 1994 model year as Honda's first entry into the growing SUV market of the 1990s in the United States.

Like various other Honda models, it re-used a name from their motorcycle division, the Honda C75 Passport. The other two name candidates were Elsinore and Odyssey, the latter would be re-used a year later on a minivan. The Passport was a part of a partnership between Isuzu and Honda in the 1990s, which saw an exchange of passenger vehicles from Honda to Isuzu, such as the Isuzu Oasis, and trucks from Isuzu to Honda, such as the Passport and Acura SLX. This arrangement was convenient for both companies, as Isuzu discontinued passenger car production in 1993 after a corporate restructuring, and Honda was in desperate need of an SUV, a segment that was growing in popularity in North America as well as Japan during the 1990s. The partnership ended in 2002 with the discontinuation of the Passport in favor of the Honda-engineered Pilot.",0

Following the production of the five s, an additional three 5,500-ton class light cruisers authorized under the 8-4 Fleet Program were ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1920.

The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts's 1464–1468 Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament. The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a Venetian patron whose identity is lost. The Entombment was first recorded in a mid-19th century Milan inventory and has been in the National Gallery, London, since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1861.

1638,"The Nasmyth telescope, also called Nasmyth–Cassegrain or Cassegrain–Nasmyth, is a reflecting telescope developed by the Scottish inventor James Nasmyth. It is a modified form of a Cassegrain telescope, with light reflected sideways to an eyepiece. Scheme
As in the Cassegrain telescope, the light falls on a concave primary mirror, then is reflected towards a convex secondary mirror. A comparatively small tertiary flat mirror reflects the light to one of the sides of the telescope. (The central hole in the primary mirror may still host a Cassegrain focus if the tertiary can be moved out of the way.) This flat mirror is placed on the altitude axis, so that the beam exits through a hole in the middle of the altitude bearing. This means the eyepiece or instrument does not need to move up and down with the telescope as the tertiary mirror's angle with the main telescope axis is adjustable as a function of the telescope's pointing and the star's elevation above the horizon;
therefore a heavy instrument can be used without upsetting the balance of the telescope or increasing the load on the altitude bearings. This has significant advantages for spectrographs and other heavy instruments typically used at research observatories. Most modern research telescopes can be configured into a Nasmyth telescope (i.e. to use the ""Nasmyth Focus"").",0

1641,"The importance and antiquity of education in Kerala is underscored by the state's ranking as among the most literate in the country. The educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries, who were the pioneers that promoted mass education in Kerala, in the early decades of the 19th century. The local dynastic precursors of modern-day Kerala—primarily the Travancore Royal Family, the Nair Service Society, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP Yogam) and Muslim Educational Society (MES)—also made significant contributions to the progress on education in Kerala. Local schools were known by the general word kalaris, some of which taught martial arts, but other village schools run by Ezhuthachans were for imparting general education. Christian missionaries and British rule brought the modern school education system to Kerala. Education in Kerala had been promoted during British rule in India as part of their policy and also by Christian missionaries. A significant figure in the 19th century was Archbishop Bernardine Baccinelli, who started a system called ""A school along with every church"" to make education available for both poor and rich. That system still continues in the present. His work has resulted in the promotion of education for girls and has become a model for the educational system in Kerala after independence. Kerala's high literacy rate is attributed to a high literacy rate among girls; as it is said, ""When a woman is educated, she will make sure that her children are well-educated.""",0

Richard Brody of The New Yorker said, ""2018 has been a banner year for movies, but you’d never know it from a trip to a local multiplex—or from a glimpse at the Oscarizables. The gap between what’s good and what’s widely available in theatres—between the cinema of resistance and the cinema of consensus—is wider than ever."" He also stated, ""In some cases, streaming has filled the gap. Several of the year’s best movies, such Shirkers and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, are being released by Netflix at the same time as (or just after) a limited theatrical run. Others, which barely qualified as having theatrical releases (one theatre for a week), are now available to stream online, on demand, and are more widely accessible to viewers (albeit at home) than films playing at thousands of multiplexes.

1653,"Teak  (Tectona grandis) is a tropical hardwood tree species in the family Lamiaceae. It is a large, deciduous tree that occurs in mixed hardwood forests. Tectona grandis has small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters (panicles) at the end of the branches. These flowers contain both types of reproductive organs (perfect flowers). The large, papery leaves of teak trees are often hairy on the lower surface. Teak wood has a leather-like smell when it is freshly milled and is particularly valued for its durability and water resistance. The wood is used for boat building, exterior construction, veneer, furniture, carving, turnings, and other small wood projects. Tectona grandis is native to south and southeast Asia, mainly Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka, but is naturalised and cultivated in many countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Myanmar's teak forests account for nearly half of the world's naturally occurring teak.

1657,"Chronic stress is the physiological or psychological response to a continuous, albeit intermittent, stressor. It is a syndrome that has been linked to a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some types of cancer.

Chronic stress can have negative consequences on both the individual and the community. It can lead to increased levels of anxiety and depression, decreased ability to cope with stress, and increased risk for substance abuse. It can also damage the body's immune system and lead to chronic inflammation.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to addressing the problem of chronic stress, but there are several ways to help individuals and communities reduce their exposure to stressors and improve their overall health.

1677,"Ethical egoism  is the normative ethical position that moral agents ought to act in their own self-interest. It differs from psychological egoism, which claims that people can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from rational egoism, which holds that it is rational to act in one's self-interest.
Ethical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer are ethical. Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical altruism, which holds that moral agents have an obligation to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's self (also known as the subject) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and ""the self"" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one is not obligated to sacrifice one's own interests (as altruism does) to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own desires or well-being) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being, but they have the choice to do so. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of consequentialism, but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both agent-focused forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or subjective). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. objective and impartial): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral ""agent's"") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.",0

1682,"Bury the Dead (1936) is an expressionist and anti-war drama by the American playwright Irwin Shaw. It dramatizes the refusal of six dead soldiers during an unspecified war—who represent a cross-section of American society—to be buried. Each rises from  a mass nameless grave to express his anguish, the futility of war, and his refusal to become part of the ""glorious past"".  First the Captain and the Generals tell them it is their duty to be buried, but they refuse.  Even a Priest and a Rabbi try to convince them to no avail. Newspapers refuse to print the story in fear it will hurt the war effort. Finally they bring in the women who have survived them, wives, sister and even mother. None succeed in the end. It was first staged in New York City in 1936 to great acclaim. Characters

1683,"A protected trust deed, overseen by the trustee, is a legal document that creates a trust. The trust deed establishes the terms and conditions under which the trust will operate. The trustee is responsible for overseeing the trust's management and ensuring that its provisions are carried out.

Protected trusts offer many advantages over traditional trusts. First, protected trusts are not subject to probate, which can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Second, protected trusts are immune from certain types of lawsuits, such as suits seeking to dissolve the trust or to recover property held in trust. Finally, protected trusts can provide a more secure foundation for estate planning because they are less likely to be challenged in court.",1

1691,"An opium pipe is a pipe designed for the evaporation and inhalation of opium. True opium pipes allow for the opiate to be vaporized while being heated over a special oil lamp known as an opium lamp. It is thought that this manner of ""smoking"" opium began in the seventeenth century when a special pipe was developed that vaporized opium instead of burning it. The configuration of the typical opium pipe consists of a long stem, a ceramic pipe-bowl, and a metal fitting, known as the ""saddle"", through which the pipe-bowl plugs into the pipe-stem. The pipe-bowl must be detachable from the stem due to the necessity to remove the bowl and scrape its insides clean of opium ash after several pipes have been smoked. The stems of opium pipes were usually made from bamboo, but other materials such as ivory and silver were used. Pipe-bowls were typically a type of ceramic, such as blue and white porcelain.

1712,"Floral Isolation is a form of reproductive isolation  found in  angiosperms. Reproductive isolation is the process of species evolving mechanisms to prevent reproduction with other species. In plants, this is accomplished through the manipulation of the pollinator’s behavior (ethological isolation) or through morphological characteristics of flowers that favor intraspecific pollen transfer (morphological isolation). Preventing interbreeding prevents hybridization and gene flow between the species                (introgression), and consequently protects genetic integrity of the species. Reproductive isolation occurs in many organisms, and floral isolation is one form present in plants. Floral isolation occurs prior to pollination, and is divided into two types of isolation: morphological isolation and ethological isolation. Floral isolation was championed by Verne Grant in the 1900s as an important mechanism of reproductive isolation in plants. Morphological Isolation 
Mechanical or morphological isolation is a form of floral isolation where the characteristics of the flower prevents reproduction between species. These morphological differences primarily affect the positioning of reproductive structures within flowers and control the placement of pollen on the pollinator’s body to promote transfer within the same species. For example, flowers of Salvia mellifera have anthers and stigmas which are positioned to contact the dorsal surface of the bumblebee abdomen while flowers of the co-occurring Salvia apiana place pollen on the bumblebee’s flanks.",0

1718,"""Atomic Dog"" is a song by George Clinton from his 1982 album Computer Games. The track was released as a single in December 1982 and became the P-Funk collective's last to reach #1 on the U.S. R&B Chart. The single failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 although it has attained a level of stature since then, partly due to its having been sampled in several hip hop songs. History
George Clinton's P-Funk reached its commercial and conceptual height during the late 1970s after the release of Mothership Connection and a series of spectacular concert tours. Each of these concerts ended with a climactic descent of a giant spaceship from the rafters. However, as the band and their concept of funk grew, the organization became entangled in internal dissension, legal disputes, and creative exhaustion. ""Atomic Dog"" was the P-Funk collective's last single to reach #1 on the U.S. R&B chart.",0

The story depicts the modern Iran, in which the call for freedom and independence among women is stronger than ever. It also highlights the sharp contrast of social behaviour between the developed cities, such as Tehran, and rural areas. While the movie includes several heartbreaking references to inequality of men and women, exploring the unhealthy relationship of family members with a feminist approach helps the audience to see how much more the movie has to offer. The movie introduces the father of Setare as a stereotypical Iranian father, who is simultaneously kind and strict, the mother, a sentimental woman who has the role of explaining the father's harsh overprotectiveness of the daughter, and the daughter who is like a lioness in chains, thirsty for every bit of freedom.",0

Three years later, however, he decided to attend the Académie Julian in Paris, where he exhibited at the Salon and discovered impressionism. Upon his return to Germany, he was one of the founders of the Munich Secession and, in 1894, helped to create the Schleswig-Holstein Art Appreciation Society.

1752,"A thought collective, a term originated in German as ""Denkkollektiv"" by the Polish and Israeli physician Ludwik Fleck, is a community of researchers who interact collectively towards the production or elaboration of knowledge using a shared framework of cultural customs and knowledge acquisition. In his 1935 book Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache; Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv, Fleck identified the scientific production of knowledge as primarily a social process that hinges upon prior discoveries and practices in a way that constrains and preconditions new ideas and concepts. He termed this shared collection of preexisting knowledge a ""Denkstil"" or thought style and formulated a comparative epistemology of science using these two ideas. Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact 
Ludwik Fleck, a Polish and Israeli physician and biologist working during the 20th century, developed an idea of scientific knowledge creation as being primarily a social practice, dependent on the cultural and historical practices within which researchers find themselves. He elaborated this idea with a series of examples in the 1935 essay Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache, together with a book of the same name, however, his ideas went largely unnoticed until Thomas Kuhn's rediscovery of them in the 1960s. Within the text, Fleck uses the identification of syphilis in the late-1800s and early-1900s as an example of a scientific fact that was supremely conditioned by the historical and social context in which it was discovered. Fleck likens the statement that a scientific fact has been ascertained, to a statement of the type ""'someone recognizes something,'"" a statement which is meaningless without further context. He continues the example to state that just as the sentence ""'Town A is situated to the left of town B'"" is incomplete without an observational reference frame, such as ""'to someone walking on the road from town C to town B,'"" so too is a scientific discovery incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it.",0

WTVF's studios are located on James Robertson Parkway in downtown Nashville, and its transmitter is located north of downtown along I-24 near Whites Creek. History
WTVF first signed on the air August 6, 1954, as WLAC-TV, originally owned by the Life and Casualty Insurance Company, and Nashville businessmen Guilford Dudley, Al Beaman and Thomas Baker. Life and Casualty's chairman of the board Paul Mountcastle and his investment group also held a majority ownership of WATE-TV, Channel 6, in Knoxville, but the two stations were not considered to be co-owned. Ever since its inception, WLAC-TV's analog signal was short-spaced to Memphis' WMC-TV, and Atlanta's WAGA-TV, also on VHF channel 5 (coincidentally, WMC-TV began on channel 4 and was immediately short-spaced to WSM-TV in Nashville, now WSMV). WLAC-TV was owned alongside WLAC radio (1510 AM) and later WLAC-FM (105.9 FM, now WNRQ). The call sign reflected the initials of the insurance company. It immediately took the CBS affiliation from WSIX-TV (channel 8, eventually WKRN-TV on channel 2) because WLAC (AM) had been Nashville's CBS Radio affiliate since 1928.

1788,"The term fellow traveller (also fellow traveler) identifies a person who is intellectually sympathetic to the ideology of a political organization, and who co-operates in the organization's politics, without being a formal member of that organization. In the early history of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet statesman Anatoly Lunacharsky coined the term poputchik ('one who travels the same path') and later it was popularized by Leon Trotsky to identify the vacillating intellectual supporters of the Bolshevik government. It was the political characterisation of the Russian intelligentsiya (writers, academics, and artists) who were philosophically sympathetic to the political, social, and economic goals of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but who did not join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The usage of the term poputchik disappeared from political discourse in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist régime, but the Western world adopted the English term fellow traveller to identify people who sympathised with the Soviets and with Communism. In U.S. politics, during the 1940s and the 1950s, the term fellow traveler was a pejorative term for a person who was philosophically sympathetic to Communism, yet was not a formal, ""card-carrying member"" of the Communist Party USA. In political discourse, the term fellow traveler was applied to intellectuals, academics, and politicians who lent their names and prestige to Communist front organizations.",0

Historians in the 1930s and 1940s often disparaged the Second Empire as a precursor of fascism. That interpretation is no longer promulgated, and by the late 20th century they were celebrating it as leading example of a modernising regime. Historians have generally given the Empire negative evaluations on its foreign policy, and somewhat more positive evaluations of domestic policies, especially after Napoleon III liberalised his rule after 1858. He promoted French business and exports. The greatest achievements came in material improvements, in the form of a grand railway network that facilitated commerce and tied the nation together and centered it on Paris.

1794,"Galleasses were military ships developed from large merchant galleys, and intended to combine galley speed with the sea-worthiness and artillery of a galleon. While perhaps never quite matching up to their full expectations, galleasses nevertheless remained significant elements in the early modern naval armoury for some considerable time. Development
Converted for military use, galleasses were higher, larger and slower than regular (""light"") galleys. They had up to 32 oars, each worked by up to five men. They usually had three masts, a forecastle and an aftcastle. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as possible to compete with regular galleys. The gun deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, but there are also pictures showing the opposite arrangement. Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, since coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, exposed an attacker to her gunfire. Relatively few galleasses were built—one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed.",0

1800,"Quechula is the name for a now-submerged village located in Chiapas, Mexico. The town was founded in the mid-1500s by Bartolomé de las Casas.

In a major departure from the North American blueprint, it was decided that the CA-27 would be powered by a licence-built version of the Rolls-Royce Avon R.A.7, rather than the General Electric J47. In theory, the Avon was capable of more than double the maximum thrust and double the thrust-to-weight ratio of the US engine. This necessitated a re-design of the fuselage, as the Avon was shorter, wider and lighter than the J47. Because of the engine change the type is sometimes referred to as the Avon Sabre. To accommodate the Avon, over 60 percent of the fuselage was altered and there was a 25 percent increase in the size of the air intake. Another major revision was in replacing the F-86F's six machine guns with two 30mm ADEN cannon, while other changes were also made to the cockpit and to provide an increased fuel capacity.",0

1821,"In the study of graph coloring problems in mathematics and computer science, a greedy coloring or sequential coloring is a coloring of the vertices of a graph formed by a greedy algorithm that considers the vertices of the graph in sequence and assigns each vertex its first available color. Greedy colorings can be found in linear time, but they do not in general use the minimum number of colors possible. Different choices of the sequence of vertices will typically produce different colorings of the given graph, so much of the study of greedy colorings has concerned how to find a good ordering. There always exists an ordering that produces an optimal coloring, but although such orderings can be found for many special classes of graphs, they are hard to find in general. Commonly used strategies for vertex ordering involve placing higher-degree vertices earlier than lower-degree vertices, or choosing vertices with fewer available colors in preference to vertices that are less constrained.",0

1825,"Historical Vishnuism as early worship of the Supreme God Vishnu goes back to at least the Vedic period (1500-500 BCE). The texts of the Vedas and the Puranas, which are the primary sources of Hindu religious teachings, discuss a variety of aspects of Vishnu worship.

There is evidence that Vishnu was worshiped as early as 3000 BCE in India. The Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished in present-day Pakistan from about 2500 to 1800 BCE, features clay figurines of a bearded man with a conical headdress and a disc on his chest. These figurines have been interpreted as representations of a deity identified with the Vedic god Varuna.

The earliest references to Vishnu as the supreme god occur in the Vedas, which were compiled between 1500 and 500 BCE. In these texts, Vishnu is described as the first and most important deity. He is also referred to as the preserver and the destroyer of worlds.

Vishnu gradually emerged as the dominant god in Hinduism during the first centuries of the Common Era (CE). This period is known as the Hindu Golden Age, and it was during this time that many of Vishnu's important temples were built. The most famous of these temples is the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in central India.

Vishnu continued to be worshiped throughout much of India even after Christianity became established in the region during the early centuries of the Common Era. This was particularly true in regions such",1

The foot of the valley leads into Miller's Dale on the River Wye, which the valley's Brook Head stream runs into.

Water quality laws are legal standards or requirements governing water quality, that is, the concentrations of water pollutants in some regulated volume of water. Such standards are generally expressed as levels of a specific water pollutants (whether chemical, physical, biological, or radiological) that are deemed acceptable in the water volume, and are generally designed relative to the water's intended use - whether for human consumption, industrial or domestic use, recreation, or as aquatic habitat. Additionally, these laws provide regulations on the alteration of the chemical, physical, radiological, and biological characteristics of water resources. Regulatory efforts may include identifying and categorizing water pollutants, dictating acceptable pollutant concentrations in water resources, and limiting pollutant discharges from effluent sources. Regulatory areas include sewage treatment and disposal, industrial and agricultural waste water management, and control of surface runoff from construction sites and urban environments. Water quality laws provides the foundation for regulations in water standards, monitoring, required inspections and permits, and enforcement.

1870,"A stack or sea stack is a geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast, formed by wave erosion. Stacks are formed over time by wind and water, processes of coastal geomorphology. They are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action, which is the force of the sea or water crashing against the rock. The force of the water weakens cracks in the headland, causing them to later collapse, forming free-standing stacks and even a small island. Without the constant presence of water, stacks also form when a natural arch collapses under gravity, due to sub-aerial processes like wind erosion. Erosion causes the arch to collapse, leaving the pillar of hard rock standing away from the coast—the stack. Eventually, erosion will cause the stack to collapse, leaving a stump. Stacks can provide important nesting locations for seabirds, and many are popular for rock climbing. Isolated steep-sided, rocky oceanic islets typically of volcanic origin, are also loosely called ""stacks"" or ""volcanic stacks"".",0

Hedsor Wharf, on the upper reach of Hedsor Water had been an important trading post. The paper made at nearby Cookham Paper Mill was shipped from there and the stone used to build Shardeloes was brought from Oxford to Hedsor Wharf.

Erfurter Bahn operates services every two hours using Regio-Shuttle diesel multiple units. The running time is 40 minutes (Regional-Express) and 65 minutes (Erfurter Bahn) each way. It is thus part of the fastest connection from Jena, Weimar and Erfurt to Hanover. History 
Already in the 1840s proposals for a railway from Frankfurt to Bavaria via Thuringia was under discussion. When construction of the Hanoverian Southern Railway (Hannöverschen Südbahn, Hanover–Göttingen–Kassel, opened in 1854) and the Werra Railway (Werrabahn, Eisenach–Meiningen–Coburg, opened in 1859) started, a connection was planned from these lines to Mühlhausen. From Göttingen to Leinefelde the line was shared with the temporary western end of the Halle–Kassel line (Nordhausen–Leinefelde–Arenshausen–Friedland–Göttingen, opened in 1867). However, the countries involved (Hanover, Prussia, Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) for a long time could not agree on an alignment, in particular the southern terminus (Eisenach, Gotha or Erfurt) was controversial. In the end, they agreed on Gotha, allowing construction to begin in 1868. In 1870, it was opened to traffic. The line connected with the existing line from the east (the Thuringian Railway, opened in 1847) in Gotha station in order to connect with the Werra Railway. This means that passengers still usually have to change trains in Gotha to reach Erfurt. The originally planned extension from Gotha to the south was never built.",0

1875,"Israel Lund (born 1980, Bellow Falls, Vermont) is a conceptual painter based in Brooklyn, New York. He creates acrylic paintings using a combination of digital and analog techniques including silk-screening; digital painting; and the manipulation of photocopies, photographs and PDFs through smartphone applications. His practice has been described as its “own distinctive kind of post-digital abstraction.” Lund's work concerns the “modularity and scalability” of analog painting. As described by critic and art historian Alex Bacon, Lund's paintings evoke an uncanny “screen-space” that is produced in an “analog-mode” via a silk-screening process, a concept that the artist refers to as “analog.jpg”. In his recent work, this process involves imprinting the palette knife through a silk screen onto the warp and weft of raw, coarse canvas. The result is a dappled or “pixelated” miasma of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Thea Ballard describes Lund's regimented technique as “ascetic”:“This method is perhaps ascetic, following strict parameters of both process and dimension; most of his works conform to the dimensions of 8.5 x 11 inches (such economical tendencies nod to Lund’s roots in hardcore punk and zine-making). His initial experiments were rendered in black and white, but Lund also uses cyan, magenta, and yellow ink, a nod to CMYK printing, method commonly used reproduce photographs in print, in which these colors overlap to create a spectrum.” Working within a set of specific material constraints, Lund pushes painterly abstraction to its absolute limit. Ballard continues: “The canvas itself is less an endpoint than several (or maybe infinite?) portals or nodes through which these images are transferred.”",0
1876,"Deinosuchus  is an extinct genus of alligatoroid crocodilian related to the modern alligator that lived 82 to 73 million years ago (Ma), during the late Cretaceous period.

Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later incorporated into an influential, though inaccurate, skull reconstruction at the American Museum of Natural History. Knowledge of Deinosuchus remains incomplete, but better cranial material found in recent years has expanded scientific understanding of this massive predator. Although Deinosuchus was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator, with the largest adults measuring  in total length, its overall appearance was fairly similar to its smaller relatives. It had large, robust teeth built for crushing, and its back was covered with thick hemispherical osteoderms. One study indicated Deinosuchus may have lived for up to 50 years, growing at a rate similar to that of modern crocodilians, but maintaining this growth over a much longer time.",0

1881,"Prométhée (Prometheus) is a tragédie lyrique (grand cantata) in three acts by the French composer Gabriel Fauré with a French libretto by the Symboliste poets Jean Lorrain and André-Ferdinand Hérold (1865-1940). It was partly based on the opening of the Greek tragedy of Prometheus Bound. The first performance at Arènes de Béziers on 27 August 1900 involved almost 800 performers (including two wind bands and 15 harps) and was watched by an audience of 10,000. Between 1914 and 1916, Jean Roger-Ducasse reworked the score for a reduced orchestra. This version (which was later revised by Fauré) made its debut at the Paris Opéra on 17 May 1917 but never became popular. Designated as a tragédie lyrique, the work resists easy categorisation. It was intended to be on a large-scale with spoken and musical sections. Warrack and West call it a grand cantata, arguing that since ""only some of the characters participate in the stage action it is scarcely an opera, though Fauré's conception of the work is at times more operatic than merely choral ...

By 1894, the U.S. Navy desired to adopt a modern small-bore, smokeless powder service cartridge and rifle in keeping with other first-line naval powers for both naval and marine forces.  Naval authorities decided that the new cartridge should be adaptable to both rifles and machine guns.  Noting that the world's military forces were adopting smaller and smaller caliber rifles with higher velocity cartridges, U.S. naval authorities decided to leapfrog the trend to smaller and smaller calibers by adopting a cartridge in 6 mm (0.236 inch) caliber, with a semi-rimmed case capable of holding up to  of 'Rifleite' smokeless powder and proof chamber pressures of up to 60,000 psi.

In practical terms, mismatch loss is a measure of how well a transmission line matches the power requirements of an electrical system.

Mismatch loss can be thought of as a proxy for transmission line efficiency. The higher the mismatch loss, the worse the line's efficiency. Conversely, a low mismatch loss indicates good line efficiency.

1900,"The Dover–Dunkerque train ferry was one of two regular rail freight train ferries that operated between the United Kingdom and Europe. The route connected the English port of Dover, with the French port of Dunkerque. After rationalisation of other Anglo-European train ferries, the Dover to Dunkerque sailing was the last to survive, though it ended its days on freight carryings only after the Night Ferry passenger service ended in 1980. The last Dover to Dunkerque wagon-freight ferry service became redundant upon the opening of the Channel Tunnel when freight was carried directly through the Channel Tunnel. History
Before the First World War, freight being shipped between the Channel ports led to a time-consuming process of shipping from source, unloading onto a ship, re-loading onto rail wagons and then onward delivery on the continent. This ran a significant cost of finance, time and also was detrimental in the amount of labour required to handle the transhipment. During the First World War, despite many innovative efforts to get military supplies to the front (such as small barges sailing across the Channel), the British military established a train ferry at Richborough to enable trains and wagons to be taken onto a ferry without having to transfer the goods from wagons. Other crossings were also established at Southampton, Dover, Newhaven and Liverpool.",0

1902,"Child psychopathology refers to the scientific study of children who have exhibited disturbed behavior or mental illness. It is a relatively new field, having emerged in the early 20th century.

There is no one answer to the question of why children develop psychopathology. However, there are several factors that are known to play a role, including genetic and environmental factors. For example, some children may be predisposed to developing psychopathology due to their genes, and may have difficulty coping with life experiences or problems in their home or family. Alternatively, environmental factors – such as maltreatment or exposure to violence – may also play a role in the development of psychopathology in children.

Psychopathology is often divided into two categories: clinical and subclinical. Clinical psychopathology refers to the presence of clinically significant symptoms – such as impaired functioning and psychiatric comorbidity – that last for at least six months. Subclinical psychopathology, by contrast, refers to symptoms that do not meet the criteria for clinically significant disorder but nonetheless interfere with an individual’s quality of life.

There is no one cure for child psychopathology, but treatment typically involves a combination of therapy and medication. Therapies that are typically used to treat child psychopathology include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), problem solving therapy (PSYCHOS), and family-based interventions (FBIs). CBT is the most commonly used type of therapy, and is typically used to treat both clinical and subclinical symptoms. PSYCHOS is",1

This Sanskritised form of Bengali is notable for its variations in verb forms and the vocabulary which is mainly composed of Sanskrit or tatsama words. It was mainly a vocabulary making it easier for literary works in Sanskrit to be translated. Notable among them was Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, who standardised the Bengali alphabet and paved the path for literary works. The colloquial usage of Bengali consisted mostly of its Prakrit base as well as indigenous (deshi), Persian and Arabic words embedded into the vocabulary. As a result, the Brahmins, a Hindu pundit caste, chose the path of Sanskritisation to make a ""pure"" language which would be used as a representative of classical languages into which the works of Sanskrit and Hindu literature can be translated. This shifted Bengali from its original Prakrit roots towards Sanskrit. This in turn increased the commonality in Bengali vocabulary with other Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindi.",0

Given the mass of data available on CXorf26, potential function is likely related to the workings of RNA polymerase II, ubiquitination, and ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The basis of these arguments is on the interaction data of human CXorf26 as well as its yeast homolog, YPL225W. Both homologs show interaction with multiple ubiquinated proteins as well as the transcriptional enzyme RNA polymerase II. For example, ubiquitiation and subsequent degradation of the 26S proteasome serves an important function in regulating transcription in eukaryotes. The yeast protein RPN11, which interacts with YPL225W, has a homolog in humans that is a metalloprotease component of 26S proteasome that also degrades proteins targeted for destruction by the ubiquitin pathway. These functions do not seem to relate to a polysaccharide biosynthesis function as would be assumed due to its conserved domain, but it may still play a role in secondary structure or sites of phosphorylation.",0

1949,"A CW complex is a kind of a topological space that is particularly important in algebraic topology.
It was introduced by J. H. C. Whitehead to meet the needs of homotopy theory. This class of spaces is broader and has some better categorical properties than simplicial complexes, but still retains a combinatorial nature that allows for computation (often with a much smaller complex). The C stands for ""closure-finite"", and the W for ""weak"" topology.
A CW complex can be defined inductively.  A 0-dimensional CW complex is just a set of zero or more discrete points (with the discrete topology).
 A 1-dimensional CW complex is constructed by taking the disjoint union of a 0-dimensional CW complex with one or more copies of the unit interval. For each copy, there is a map that ""glues"" its boundary (its two endpoints) to elements of the 0-dimensional complex (the points). The topology of the CW complex is the topology of the quotient space defined by these gluing maps.
 In general, an n-dimensional CW complex is constructed by taking the disjoint union of a k-dimensional CW complex (for some ) with one or more copies of the n-dimensional ball. For each copy, there is a map that ""glues"" its boundary (the -dimensional sphere) to elements of the -dimensional complex. The topology of the CW complex is the quotient topology defined by these gluing maps.
 An infinite-dimensional CW complex can be constructed by repeating the above process countably many times.
In an n-dimensional CW complex, for every , a k-cell is the interior of a k-dimensional ball added at the k-th step. The k-skeleton of the complex is the union of all its k-cells.",0
1950,"The Mark 10 torpedo was a torpedo put into use by the United States in 1915. It was derived from the Mark 9 aircraft torpedo converted to submarine use. It was used as the primary torpedo in the R- and S-class submarines. It used alcohol-water steam turbine propulsion. It was succeeded by the problematic Mark 14 torpedo, but remained in service in S-boats and fleet submarines through the Pacific War. The Mark 10 featured the largest warhead ( of TNT) of any U.S. torpedo developed at that time. Stockpiles of Mark 10 Mod 3 torpedoes were used extensively during the first part of World War II due to short supply of the newer and longer ( Mark 14s, with some fleet submarines carrying a mixture of both types on patrol.

1963,"Medieval stone moulds are well represented in museums, however very little is known about their origins and use.

Stone moulds are artefacts made from stone, typically used in the production of figurines, reliefs and other sculptures. They are one of the oldest forms of sculptural decoration, dating back to the prehistoric period. They were generally used in the eastern Mediterranean and Europe until the early modern period, when they were replaced by metal Casting.

The most common type of stone mould is the 'slab mold', which is a rectangular block with a series of smooth indentations on one or both sides. This type was used to produce reliefs, and was especially popular in Ancient Greece. The 'pillar mold' is similar to the slab mold, but has smaller indentations on either side of the block. It was used to produce statuary, and was particularly popular in Ancient Rome. The 'cusp mold' is a slender block with triangular indentations on one or both sides.

1970,"A preference test is an experiment in which animals are allowed free access to multiple environments which differ in one or more ways.  Various aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured with respect to the alternative environments, such as latency and frequency of entry, duration of time spent, range of activities observed, or relative consumption of a goal object in the environment. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software. Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see ""Advantages and disadvantages"" below. Statistical testing is used to determine whether observed differences in such measures support the conclusion that preference or aversion has occurred.   Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the environments to habituate and reduce the effects of novelty. Preference tests can be used to test for preferences of only one characteristic of an environment, e.g. cage colour, or multiple characteristics e.g. a choice between hamster wheel, Habitrail tunnels or additional empty space for extended locomotion.",0

1976,"A Riboprobe, abbreviation of RNA probe, is a segment of labelled RNA that can be used to detect a target mRNA or DNA during in situ hybridization. RNA probes can be produced by in vitro transcription of cloned DNA inserted in a suitable plasmid downstream of a viral promoter. Some bacterial viruses code for their own RNA polymerases, which are highly specific for the viral promoters. Using these enzymes, labeled NTPs, and inserts inserted in both forward and reverse orientations, both sense and antisense riboprobes can be generated from a cloned gene. Since James Watson and Francis Crick revealed the double helix nature of DNA molecule (Watson & Crick, 1953), the hydrogen bonds between the four bases are well known: adenine always binds to thymine and cytosine always binds to guanine. This binding pattern is the basic principle of modern genetic technologies. Joseph Gall and Mary Lou Pardue published a paper in 1969 demonstrating that radioactive marked ribosomal DNA can be used to detect its complementary DNA sequence in a frog egg, known as the first researchers who use DNA probes to perform in situ hybridization. RNA probes were proved to be able to perform the same function and also used with in situ hybridization. Fluorescent dyed probes replaced radio labeled probes due to the consideration of safety, stability, and ease of detection.

Their difference toward the n carriages was their lower floor height with more comfortable entrances, interior design built to higher standards with a larger seat pitch, big improvements in the heating and ventilation systems and, constructionally, a lower overall weight. The interior design combined many elements of the DB diesel units 614 and 628.0 that had been built a few years earlier.

The forces of Hawaiʻi were led by Kamehameha I, while the forces of Maui were led by Kalanikūpule. It is known as one of the most bitter battles fought in Hawaiian history.  While Maui's King Kahekili II was on Oʻahu, Kamehameha's war fleet landed in Kahului a few kilometers from the base of ʻĪao Valley. An army consisting of around twelve hundred skilled warriors led by Kamehameha and Kekuhaupiʻo, advanced on Kahekili's son Kalanikūpule and other Maui chiefs blocking the ʻĪao valley. The two armies were evenly matched and neither side broke after two days of fighting. On the third day, Kamehameha's army was helped by the use of two cannons (named ""Lopaka"" and ""Kalola"") operated by John Young and Isaac Davis, two of Kamehameha's royal advisors.

It follows the actions of a secret organization known as the Sanctuary, who track down a series of creatures known as abnormals, and then bring them to the Sanctuary for refuge.
The main story arc of the season involves the Sanctuary working against the Cabal, an organization who seek to control all abnormals for their own gain.

2024,"The Devon School is a fictional school created by author John Knowles in the novels A Separate Peace and Peace Breaks Out. It is based on Knowles' alma mater, Phillips Exeter Academy. Like Phillips Exeter during World War II, Devon is a boys' boarding school in New Hampshire. Knowles places the school in a town that bears its name, specifically at the head of a quaint residential street called Gilman Street. The school ""emerged naturally from the town which had produced it."" A Separate Peace covers the summer of 1942 and the Winter Session of 1942-1943. The senior year students are being prepared for the war. The timeframe in Peace Breaks Out is 1946-1947. In both of these books, Devon is portrayed as a boys' preparatory school, just as Phillips Exeter was at the time; although Phillips Exeter is today a co-educational school. The Devon School is one of the most prominent fictional examples of a total institution. Description 
The approach from Gilman Street gradually gives way to the Far Common, a leafy, manicured expanse of ground that proceeds the First Academy Building, which Knowles derives almost entirely from the Academy Building at Phillips Exeter, having the same cupola and similar Latin inscription over the entrance. The First Academy Building, the Georgian red brick dormitories, and the Gothic-style chapel, form a quadrangle around the Center Common. There is then a group of Colonial houses for the Dean, the Headmaster, and other faculty members, along an old London-style lane leading from the dormitories to the Naguamsett River and the Crew House. Progressing in another direction, past the Field House (or ""The Cage"") the Center Common opens onto the Playing Fields, with tennis courts on the left, the Devon Woods on the right, and enormous open grounds for playing football, lacrosse and soccer. Directly ahead, far across the Playing Fields, is the stadium (which envelops the swimming pool), the Devon River and the climactic tree that is the basis for a very crucial part of the plot. Beyond all that, Knowles names the excess wilderness as the Fields Beyond.",0

2045,"The Web Planet is the fifth serial of the second season in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Written by Bill Strutton and directed by Richard Martin, the serial was broadcast on BBC1 in six weekly parts from 13 February to 20 March 1965. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and his travelling companions Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), and Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) ally themselves with the Menoptra, the former inhabitants of the planet Vortis, as they struggle to win back the planet from the malignant Animus (Catherine Fleming) and its Zarbi slaves. When crafting an idea for the serial, Strutton recalled a memory as a child of watching two bull ants fighting, which he linked with his two sons fighting each other. Story editor Dennis Spooner found the narrative to be multilayered, with the Menoptra representing free enterprise and the Zarbi communism. Martin hired a mime artist to develop choreography for the serial, and forewent a traditional score in favour of prerecorded stock music. The Web Planet premiered with 13.5 million viewers, the highest in the series to date; it maintained high viewership across the six weeks. Reviews were mixed, with praise directed at its choreography and action, and criticism towards its costumes and confusing story; retrospective reviews applauded the serial's ambition despite its outdated visuals.

2049,"In molecular biology, the protein Sprouty is a developmental protein involved in cell signalling.
It works by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway. Function
The function of this protein has been found, in Drosophila to  inhibit branching of the trachea by antagonizing the BNL-FGF pathway. Also in Drosophila it is an antagonist of EGFR-mediated signaling in the eye. Most notably, in humans,  it suppresses the insulin receptor and EGFR-transduced MAPK signaling pathway, but does not inhibit MAPK activation by a constitutively active mutant Ras. Sprouty inhibits of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, a pathway crucial for developmental processes initiated by activation of various receptor tyrosine kinases. These proteins share a conserved, C-terminal cysteine-rich region, the SPR domain. This domain has been defined as a novel cytosol to membrane translocation domain. It has been found to be a PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding domain that targets the proteins to a cellular localization that maximizes their inhibitory potential. It also mediates homodimer formation of these proteins.",0

2051,"Fisher Peak is an 8,040-foot-elevation mountain summit located in the North Cascades of Washington state. It is situated on the borders of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and North Cascades National Park, midway between Black Peak and Easy Pass, and adjacent to Repulse Peak. Precipitation runoff from Fisher Peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate
Fisher Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.",0

2053,"describes a type of printed Japanese book that was produced primarily in Kyoto between 1600 and 1680.  The term literally means “books written in kana” (kana being the phonetic Japanese syllabary that is simpler to read and write than kanji, or Chinese ideographs).  The designation thus derives from the fact that the text of these books was written either entirely in kana or in a mixture of kana and kanji.  Kanazōshi are considered to be a transitional genre, bridging the gap between medieval romances and the first high point of Edo period (1600-1868) literature, the ukiyozōshi composed by Ihara Saikaku (1642–93). The genre comprises an unlikely assortment of essays, stories, travel guides for famous places, military chronicles, religious writings, and critical pieces.  Despite the lack of uniformity in content, kanazōshi are classified as a distinct genre primarily based on the fact that they were the first literary works to be printed and widely circulated in Japan.  Scholars also maintain that kanazōshi are generally of higher literary quality and more realistic than medieval forms, such as the otogizōshi, that preceded them. Characteristics of Kanazōshi
Before the 1620s, the only books available in Japan were handwritten manuscripts.  The printed kanazōshi were less expensive and more widely available than these earlier manuscripts.  They are thus considered the first example of commercial literature produced in Japan.  One should keep in mind, however, the comparatively limited nature of their popularity.  The cost of a single volume was still prohibitive, costing roughly the equivalent of what a laborer could earn for two or three days of work (4000 of Japanese currency).  Moreover, the books, because of their small print runs (often only a few hundred copies), rarely circulated beyond Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo, the publishing centers in premodern Japan.",0

2071,"Post-occupation Japan is the period in postwar Japanese history which started when the Allied occupation of Japan ended in 1952 and lasted to the end of the Showa era in 1989. Despite the massive devastation it suffered in the Second World War, Japan established itself as a rich global economic power at peace with the world. In terms of political power it was more reluctant, especially in the nonuse of military force. The post-war constitution of 1946 included Article 9 clause, which restricted Japan from having a military force and engaging in war. However, it has operated military forces in the form of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces since 1954. Over the years, the meaning of article 9 has been interpreted differently, because the United States now encourages Japan to control its own security and to join their military strategy more. The  Liberal Democratic Party would like to see the Constitution and Article 9 amended. Politics ",0

2073,"Immunocompetence is the ability of the body to produce a normal immune response following exposure to an antigen. Immunocompetence is the opposite of immunodeficiency or immuno-incompetent or immuno-compromised. Examples include:
 a newborn who does not yet have a fully functioning immune system but may have maternally transmitted antibodies – immunodeficient; 
 a late stage AIDS patient with a failed or failing immune system – immuno-incompetent; or 
 a transplant recipient taking medication so their body will not reject the donated organ – immunocompromised. 
There may be cases of overlap but these terms all describe immune system not fully functioning. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that household and other close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence receive the MMR, varicella, and rotavirus vaccines according to the standard schedule of vaccines, as well as receiving an annual flu shot. All other vaccines may be administered to contacts without alteration to the vaccine schedule, with the exception of the smallpox vaccine. Persons with altered immunocompetence should not receive live, attenuated vaccines (viral or bacterial), and may not receive the full benefit of inactivated vaccines.",0

2098,"Tourette syndrome or Tourette's syndrome (abbreviated as TS or Tourette's) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood or adolescence. It is characterized by multiple movement (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. Common tics are blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. These are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles known as a premonitory urge, can sometimes be suppressed temporarily, and characteristically change in location, strength, and frequency. Tourette's is at the more severe end of a spectrum of tic disorders. The tics often go unnoticed by casual observers. Tourette's was once regarded as a rare and bizarre syndrome and has popularly been associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks). It is no longer considered rare; about 1% of school-age children and adolescents are estimated to have Tourette's, and coprolalia occurs only in a minority. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified, because most cases are mild, and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Therefore, many go undiagnosed or may never seek medical attention. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is rare, but for a small minority, severely debilitating tics can persist into adulthood. Tourette's does not affect intelligence or life expectancy.",0

2104,"Lepidotes (from  , 'covered with scales') (previously known as Lepidotus) is an extinct genus of Mesozoic ray-finned fish. It has been considered a wastebasket taxon, characterised by ""general features, such as thick rhomboid scales and, for most of the species, by semi-tritorial or strongly tritorial dentition."" with dozens of species assigned to it. Fossil attributed to Lepidotes have been found in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks worldwide. It has been argued that Lepidotes should be restricted to species closely related to the type species L. gigas, which are only known from the Early Jurassic of Central Europe, with most other species being not closely related. Lepidotes belongs to Ginglymodi, a clade of fish whose only living representatives are the gars (Lepisosteidae). The type species L. gigas and close relatives are thought to be members of Lepisosteiformes within Ginglymodi, with other species occupying various positions within Ginglymodi, such as the Semionotiformes.

2118,"A valveless pulsejet (or pulse jet) is the simplest known jet propulsion device. Valveless pulsejets are low in cost, light weight, powerful and easy to operate. They have all the advantages (and most of the disadvantages) of conventional valved pulsejets, but without the reed valves that need frequent replacement - a valveless pulsejet can operate for its entire useful life with practically zero maintenance. They have been used to power model aircraft, experimental go-karts, and unmanned military aircraft such as cruise missiles and target drones. Basic characteristics
A pulsejet engine is an air-breathing reaction engine that employs an ongoing sequence of discrete combustion events rather than one sustained combustion event.  This clearly distinguishes it from other reaction engine types such as rockets, turbojets, and ramjets, which are all constant combustion devices.  All other reaction engines are driven by maintaining high internal pressure; pulsejets are driven by an alternation between high and low pressure.  This alternation is not maintained by any mechanical contrivance, but rather by the natural acoustic resonance of the rigid tubular engine structure.  The valveless pulsejet is, mechanically speaking, the simplest form of pulsejet, and is, in fact, the simplest known air-breathing propulsion device that can operate ""statically"", i.e. without forward motion.",0

2140,"A skwal is the main piece of equipment used for skwalling, a hybrid sport combining the carving of skiing and riding feel of snowboarding. It is similar to a snowboard or monoski in that both feet are attached to the same board. On a skwal the feet are one in front of the other, in line with the direction the skwal is pointing in. This differs from snowboards (in which the feet are side-on to the direction of the board) and monoskis (in which the feet point in the direction of the board, but are side-by-side). History 
The skwal was invented by two French ski-school instructors Patrick ""Thias"" Balmain and Manuel Jammes, with the first prototype appearing in 1992. They envisaged it as a way to offer different sensations to what skiing and snowboarding could offer, at a time when 'carving' skis were only just starting to take off.  A French company called Lacroix took an interest, recruited Patrick Balmain, and started producing skwals. A few years later, Patrick left Lacroix and started his own skwal-making company. There are now several other makers of skwals, though the sport has never gained the widespread popularity its creators predicted - possibly due to the perceived difficulty of the sport.",0

2142,"Center Moriches  was a station stop along the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. It was located on Railroad Avenue and Hamilton Street in Center Moriches, New York. History
The station was built by the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, around 1881 as ""Moriches Station"" after the original Moriches station was renamed for the geographically correct Eastport, New York. At some point the station was renamed as well for the more geographically correct Center Moriches, New York. Until 1906, it was also a terminal with a wye, a small yard, and a transfer point for one of the east end scoots. When East Moriches and Eastport stations were closed by the Long Island Rail Road on October 6, 1958, commuters who used those stations were advised to use Center Moriches station, thus transforming it into the last railroad station in the Moricheses. The station house was razed in 1964, but a new shelter was built sometime around 1985. The station closed on March 16, 1998; at the time, it only served 5 passengers per day. The arrival of the C3 bi-level coaches meant that all stations in the LIRR's diesel territory had to receive high-level platforms, and building new platforms for such a low-usage station was not cost-effective.",0

2147,"A plea colloquy, in United States criminal procedure, is a conversation between a judge and a criminal defendant who has been sworn under oath, which must occur when the defendant enters a guilty plea in court in order for the plea to be valid. The United States Supreme Court has crafted a doctrine which requires the court to engage in a specific line of inquiry. Because a guilty plea must be made intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily, the court must advise the defendant of the following things:
The nature of the charge
The potential penalties which might result from the plea, including any mandatory minimum sentence
The defendant's rights to not plead guilty, and to request a jury trial.
The court must ask the defendant if he understands each of these points, and must receive a voluntary affirmative response. Many courts use a script of the questions which the judge will ask the defendant and the defense attorney in a specific order. Failure by the court to advise the defendant of any of the above points will supply the grounds for a collateral attack on the plea; if such an attack is successful, the guilty plea will be withdrawn, and the defendant will be given the opportunity to enter a new plea. The court can accept and bind the defendant to a guilty plea, even if the defendant insists that he is innocent, and merely taking the plea to avoid conviction by a jury. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a criminal defendant has the right to be represented by an attorney during a plea colloquy; failure of the state to provide an attorney to an indigent defendant during such proceedings is grounds for an appeal. It is possible - but very difficult - for a defendant who is so represented to have a plea thrown out due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant must make a positive showing that but for the erroneous advice of counsel, he would not have chosen to plead guilty.",0

The island of Timor was first settled by Austronesian speaking peoples around 1000 BC. The first European to sight the island was Portuguese navigator Álvaro de Mendaña in 1512. Portuguese traders and missionaries began arriving in the early 16th century, and by 1542 they had established a foothold on the island. In 1570, the Portuguese established a fortress on the northeast coast of Timor, which they named Fort São João Baptista. In 1602, King Manuel I of Portugal granted Portuguese Timor a governorate with its own judicial system and taxation system. The Portuguese attempted to convert the native population to Christianity, with some success. In 1884, following a series of wars with Dutch and British colonialists, Portugal ceded sovereignty over Timor to the Dutch East Indies. In 1942, during World War II, Japanese forces invaded Timor and declared it part of the Japanese empire. After Japan's defeat in 1945, Australian forces took control of the island. In 1959, Indonesia claimed sovereignty over the island following a referendum in which 98% of voters supported incorporation into Indonesia. In 1975, following a failed attempt to overthrow Indonesian rule by pro-independence militants, Timor became an independent nation under the name Republic of East Timor.

2169,"Chrysosporium keratinophilum is a mold that is closely related to the dermatophytic fungi (Family Arthrodermataceae) and is mainly found in soil and the coats of wild animals to break down keratin. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is one of the more commonly occurring species of the genus Chrysosporium in nature. It is easily detected due to its characteristic ""light-bulb"" shape and flat base. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is most commonly found in keratin-rich, dead materials such as feathers, skin scales, hair, and hooves. Although not identified as pathogenic, it is a regular contaminant of cutaneous specimens which leads to the common misinterpretation that this fungus is pathogenic. Description
Chrysosporium keratinophilum colonies grow rapidly at 25 °C approximately 60–100 mm in 21 days. Colonies can be flat or folded, dry, powdery, or velvety with a white- or cream-coloured center The colony surface is dotted with droplets of clear or brown exuded liquid. The hyphae are septate and the conidia are hyaline, broad-based and one-celled. The conidia are large, smooth to slightly rough-walled, sometimes slightly curved and occasionally septate. The conidia  are broadly ""light-bulb"" shaped with an abruptly flattened smooth base. Colonies grow to about 30 mm in diameter in one week and are flat with a powdery to suede-like texture. The colony reverse is also cream-coloured. Chrysosporium keratinophilum produces abundant aleurioconidia that resemble the microconidia of dermatophytes; however, the conidia of C. keratinophilum are considerably larger.  Chrysosporium keratinophilum has been associated with two closely related sexual states: Aphanoascus keratinophilus and Aphanoascus fulvescens.",0

DE 404 begins at an interchange with DE 1 in Elkton, heading northeast on six-lane freeway. The highway crosses the Delaware River into New Castle County and enters the city of Wilmington. In Wilmington, DE 404 becomes an urban boulevard and comes to an intersection with US 13. The freeway passes through the University of Delaware campus before reaching an interchange with DE 1A (DE 302), which provides access to Newark and Dover. After this interchange, DE 404 becomes a six-lane divided highway and continues northeast through suburban areas to the city of Harrington. In Harrington, the highway crosses the Christina River into Kent County and reaches its eastern terminus at an interchange with DE 1A in Newark.

DE 404 has been designated as a part of the National Highway System (NHS) since it was established in 1956.

2173,"Object literacy is a relatively new term that has grown out of Object Based Learning (OBL), which has long been a fundamental part of museum and library work. The increasing availability of digital images and texts makes objects more accessible than ever. Now that the objects and texts are more available, there is an increasing interest in the physicality of the object or text, and a growing understanding of the need to understand objects and texts in the fullest, most comprehensive context. Definitions of Object Literacy 
 ""Object literacy is a special skill gained through the process of discovery and discussion about original objects. It is a skill which, like others, must be learned. Museums have original objects, artifacts, or works of art. Therefore, museums are logical places in which to teach people to become object literate."" - Sally Leahy (1995)
 Object literacy is also seen as ""a subset of visual literacy, leading to a new brand of museum literacy."" - Carin Jacobs (2009)
 Object literacy recognizes ""the current trend for printed material and text as a visual medium” in which people “study ways in which the physical aspects of rare books [and other objects] contribute to the understanding the text”.",0

2181,"Peshischa (Yiddish: פשיסחה) was an important Hasidic school of thought based out of Przysucha, Poland founded by Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz, which flourished during the late 18th to early 19th century. Its teachings are the foundation for Kotzk Hasidism, Ger Hasidism, Amshinov Hasidism, Zychlin Hasidism, Aleksander Hasidism, Vurka Hasidism, Sochatchov Hasidim, Porisov Hasidim, Biala Hasidim and Izhbitza-Radzin Hasidism. History 
Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz preached an elitist, rationalistic Hasidism that centered on Talmudic study and formed a counterpoint to the miracle-centered Hasidism of Lublin. His immediate successor, Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, brought Peshischa to its highest point and kickstarted a counter-revolutionary movement which challenged the Hasidic norm. While under the leadership of Rabinowicz, Peshischa was closer to a philosophy whereas, under Simcha Bunim it was transformed into a religious movement. Under Simcha Bunim's leadership, centers were created across Poland that held ideologically alliance to Peshischa. These centers preached Simcha Bunim's ideals of rationalism, radical personhood, independence and the constant quest for authenticity. He outwardly challenged the dynastic nature of Hasidic rebbes, which led to several unsuccessful attempts by contemporary Hasidic leadership to excommunicate Peshischa. After his death in 1827, Peshischa split into two factions, those of his more radical followers who supported Menachem Mendel of Kotzk as Simcha Bunim's successor and those of his less radical followers who supported the succession of Simcha Bunim's son Avraham Moshe Bonhardt. However, after Avraham Moshe's death a year later in 1828, the community almost unanimously followed Menachem Mendel, who gradually incorporated most of the community into Kotzk. After his death in 1859, Peshischa ceased to exist as a separate movement, yet its ideals still exist as the foundation for a large percentage of modern Hasidism.",0

The convoy was also accompanied initially by a local escort group from Britain, and joined later by a local escort group from Murmansk. 
There was no capital ship force providing distant cover, as Germany's only remaining heavy unit in the Arctic, Tirpitz, was still non-operational following the attack by British X-craft (Operation Source), but a cruiser cover force comprising Berwick and Jamaica followed the convoy, to guard against attack by smaller surface units.",0

2188,"The Cattaro mutiny occurred during World War I. Sailors of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Bay of Cattaro (today: Kotor, Montenegro), which at that time belonged to Austria-Hungary started it on 1 February 1918. The mutiny remained isolated and had to be abandoned after three days due to the arrival of loyal troops. Four sailors were subsequently executed according to martial law. The naval historian Halpern portrays this event as the last victory of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy over the social forces that would eventually overwhelm it. Historical background
At the beginning of 1918, dissatisfaction with the food situation, with the political conditions, as well as war fatigue had increased further. After the Russian October Revolution of 1917 and the peace offer of the Bolsheviks, wide circles, especially of the working class, feared that the German Supreme Army Command could jeopardise the hoped-for peace on the Eastern Front by making excessive demands. In protest, the Jännerstreik occurred with over 700,000 participants throughout Austria-Hungary. Workers' councils were formed, which also demanded better supplies, the abolition of censorship, the end of martial law and the introduction of the eight-hour day. The strike wave also reached the naval arsenal in Pola. After the strikes in the Monarchy ended for the most part on 21 January, work was also resumed in Pola on 28 January. Presumably unaware of the end of the actions, the sailors of the warships anchored in Cattaro decided to hold a demonstration, which they hoped would give the movement further impetus.",0

2201,"Brand language is the body of words, phrases, and images used by a brand to communicate with consumers. It can take the form of a name, logo, slogan, or other graphic representation of the brand.

Brand language is important for two reasons. First, it can help consumers remember and identify the brand. Second, it can influence how consumers think and feel about the brand. For example, a brand that uses positive words to describe itself may be seen as credible and trustworthy by consumers. Conversely, a brand that uses negative words may be seen as aggressive and unapproachable.

There are many different factors that contribute to the development of a brand's language. For example, a company may choose to use specific words or phrases to convey its image or message because they are familiar and associated with the company or because they are relevant to the product or service being offered. Additionally, a company may choose to use specific language to appeal to certain target audiences (e.g., young adults).

The use of brand language is an important part of marketing strategy for businesses of all sizes. It can help create positive customer perceptions and encourage repeat business.",1
2202,"Jewish assimilation (, Hitbolelut) refers to the gradual cultural assimilation and social integration of Jews in their surrounding culture as well as the ideological program promoting conformity as a potential solution to historic Jewish marginalization in the age of emancipation. Terminology 
Todd Endelman (2015) used the following terms to describe various forms of Jewish assimilation:
 Radical assimilation: 'an umbrella term referring to all the routes Jews traveled to lose their Jewishness, whether that was their intention or not'.
 Conversion: 'the religious act of formally embracing Christianity'.
 Secession: 'the act of legally withdrawing from the Jewish community—whether or not conversion to Christianity followed.' Endelman noted that secession did not become available until the late 19th century, and only in Central Europe (German Empire and Austria-Hungary).
 Intermarriage: 'the union between a Christian and Jew'. Endelman excluded marriages between baptised Jews and Christians or between Jews and ex-Christians from this definition, since they were legally and religiously considered 'endogamous'.
 Passing: 'the attempt to flee the Jewish community by assuming a non-Jewish identity and hiding evidence of a Jewish birth and upbringing'. According to Endelman, most people in this category never converted to Christianity, because that would have revealed they had once been Jews.",0

Colonel William Dundas designed the 112 cwt version in 1841 and it was cast the following year. The most common variant, weighing 95 cwt, dates from 1846.  It entered service with the Royal Artillery and the Royal Navy and saw active service with both arms during the Crimean War. Over 2,000 were made and it gained a reputation as the finest smoothbore cannon ever made. The gun was produced at a time when new rifled and breech loading guns were beginning to make their mark on artillery.  At first the 68-pounder's reliability and power meant that it was retained even on new warships such as HMS Warrior, but eventually new rifled muzzle loaders made all smoothbore muzzle-loading guns obsolete. However, the large surplus stocks of 68-pounders were given new life when converted to take rifled projectiles; the cannon remained in service and was not declared obsolete until 1921.",0

2211,"The Ship of State is an ancient and oft-cited metaphor, famously expounded by Plato in the Republic (Book 6, 488a–489d), which likens the governance of a city-state to the command of a vessel. Plato expands the established metaphor and ultimately argues that the only people fit to be captain of the ship  are philosopher kings, benevolent men with absolute power who have access to the Form of the Good. The origins of the metaphor can be traced back to the lyric poet Alcaeus (fragments 6, 208, 249), and it is also found in Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes, Sophocles' Antigone and Aristophanes' Wasps before Plato. Plato's use of the metaphor
Plato establishes the comparison by saying that Zeus was one of the best models of describing the steering of a ship as just like any other ""craft"" or profession—in particular, that of a statesman.  He then runs the metaphor in reference to a particular type of government: democracy.  Plato's democracy is not the modern notion of a mix of democracy and republicanism, but rather direct democracy by way of pure majority rule.  In the metaphor, found at 488a–489d, Plato's Socrates compares the population at large to a strong but near-sighted shipowner whose knowledge of seafaring is lacking. The quarreling sailors are demagogues and politicians, and the ship's navigator, a stargazer, is the philosopher. The sailors flatter themselves with claims to knowledge of sailing, though they know nothing of navigation, and are constantly vying with one another for the approval of the shipowner so to captain the ship, going so far as to stupefy the shipowner with drugs and wine. Meanwhile, they dismiss the navigator as a useless stargazer, though he is the only one with adequate knowledge to direct the ship's course.",0

2216,"The Banovina of Croatia or Banate of Croatia ( / Бановина Хрватска) was an autonomous province (banovina) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1939 and 1941. It was formed by a merger of Sava and Littoral banovinas into a single autonomous entity, with small parts of the Drina, Zeta, and Danube banovinas also included. Its capital was Zagreb and it included most of present-day Croatia along with portions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Its sole Ban during this period was Ivan Šubašić. Background
In the Vidovdan Constitution of 1921, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes had established 33 administrative districts, each headed by a government-appointed prefect. Both the Vidovdan Constitution in general and the administrative districts in particular were part of the design of Nikola Pašić and Svetozar Pribićević to maximize the power of the ethnic Serb population within the new state. The new constitution was passed in a political climate favorable to the Serbian centralists, as the Croatian regionalists chose to abstain from parliamentary duty, whereas the deputies of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia were excluded by a parliamentary vote. An amendment to the electoral law in June of 1922 further stacked the deck in favor of the Serbian population, when electoral constituencies were created based on pre-war census figures, allowing Serbia to ignore its massive military casualties sustained in the First World War. This only furthered the resentment felt by the proponents of a federate or confederate state towards the government, particularly the Croatian regionalists of the Croatian Republican Peasant Party (HRSS) around Stjepan Radić. Radić was shot in parliament by a Serbian delegate in 1928 and died two months later. This provoked the withdrawal of the HRSS from the assembly, forged an anti-Belgrade mindset in Croatia and ultimately led to the collapse of the constitutional system of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.",0

2220,"Tabula rasa (; ""blank slate"") is the theory that individuals are born without built-in mental content, and therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception. Epistemological proponents of tabula rasa disagree with the doctrine of innatism, which holds that the mind is born already in possession of certain knowledge. Proponents of the tabula rasa theory also favour the ""nurture"" side of the nature versus nurture debate when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, knowledge, and sapience. Etymology
Tabula rasa is a Latin phrase often translated as ""clean slate"" in English and originates from the Roman tabula, a wax-covered tablet used for notes, which was blanked (rasa) by heating the wax and then smoothing it. This roughly equates to the English term ""blank slate"" (or, more literally, ""erased slate"") which refers to the emptiness of a slate prior to it being written on with chalk. Both may be renewed repeatedly, by melting the wax of the tablet or by erasing the chalk on the slate.",0

2242,"An umbrella or parasol is a folding canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs that is usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole. It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight. The term umbrella is traditionally used when protecting oneself from rain, with parasol used when protecting oneself from sunlight, though the terms continue to be used interchangeably. Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof, and some umbrellas are transparent. Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic. There are also combinations of parasol and umbrella that are called en-tout-cas (French for ""in any case""). Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas can be divided into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag, and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed. Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which spring open at the press of a button.",0

He is said to be a very magical being, and that's what makes the children think that the man they've met is the Krakonoš, because in their eyes he can fly. Of course, he isn't actually flying: the film is set when skiing was unheard of, so a man with long wooden sticks on his feet that speeds over the snow would seem like a magical being. However, the person that they befriend is actually a smuggler, who crosses the Polish border every now and then to bring over goods that the poor people on the Czech side can actually afford.

The garbage patch is an area where plastic has accumulated to such an extent that it becomes a hazard to marine life. It has been estimated that there are now over 80 million pieces of plastic in the patch, weighing a total of 100,000 metric tons. The concentration of trash in the patch is four times greater than in areas near land.

The garbage patch has generated significant environmental concern, as it is a major source of pollution in the North Pacific Ocean and can potentially harm marine life. The presence of plastic in the water can block sunlight and disrupt the food chain, leading to the death of marine creatures. Additionally, the accumulation of plastic can create physical barriers that prevent fish and other sea life from migrating.",1

Filmed by the Andersons' production company Century 21, it stars Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl and Patrick Wymark. Outside Europe, it was released as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, the title by which it is now more commonly known. Set in the year 2069, the film concerns a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a newly discovered planet which lies directly opposite Earth on the far side of the Sun. The mission ends in disaster and the death of one of the astronauts, following which his colleague realises that the planet is a mirror image of Earth in every detail, with a parallel and duplicate timeline. The film was the first major live-action production by the Andersons, known for their puppet television programmes such as Thunderbirds. Having conceived the story as a television play, they were encouraged by their employer Lew Grade to turn it into a feature film, and pitched it to Jay Kanter of Universal Pictures. Though underwhelmed by the script, Kanter greenlit the film after the Andersons hired Parrish as director. Doppelgänger was shot between July and October 1968 at Pinewood Studios and on location in England and Portugal. The relationship between Parrish and the Andersons became strained as filming progressed, while creative disagreements between Gerry Anderson and his business partner John Read, the film's director of photography, led to Read's dismissal from Century 21. In an effort to distinguish Doppelgänger from their puppet productions, the Andersons wrote adult themes into the script, and cuts were required for the film to be awarded an A certificate by the British Board of Film Censors.

2263,"A Parisian Model is a 1906 Edwardian musical comedy with music by Max Hoffman, Sr. to a book and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. The story concerns a dressmaker's model who comes into a fortune. It opened on Broadway in 1906, ran with success and toured. It was produced by Frank McKee and Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., and starred Anna Held, Ziegfeld's common law wife. Soon after the success of this piece, Ziegfeld would launch his famous series of Ziegfeld Follies revues. Background

At the time, none of the large main line motor yacht builders (Matthews, Owens, C.P. Leeks (Pacemaker), etc.) were building in fiberglass. Hatteras Yachts, which had started as a partnership between two North Carolina furniture makers, and Pearson, generally noted for their fiberglass auxiliary sailboat cruisers, were the only companies making fiberglass boats over 30' in length. ""The 38 Commander Express cruiser was the pivotal boat in the development of fiberglass technology by Chris-Craft Industries. It was the first all-fiberglass cruiser made by Chris-Craft. Its production bridged the past to the future as it was the last design by ""Mac"" Mackerer who had worked for Chris-Craft as far back as 1925, also working with Fred Hudson, who styled the first 38 Commander.

Though experienced with research in both fluid mechanics and applied mathematics, he is primarily known for his pioneering work in mathematical biology, especially research on human circadian rhythms.  Kronauer's 1982 paper ""Mathematical model of the human circadian system with two interacting oscillators"" outlined a new method for understanding the biological circuits that underlie daily body cycles in variables such as blood pressure or body temperature.  Professor Kronauer's research also has direct implications for the causes and possible cures for many types of sleep disorders, and for this he will receive the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine in June 2008.

The apparent visual magnitude of this star ranges from 3.57 down to 3.80, which is bright enough to be visible with the naked eye. It lies just 0.39 degrees south of the ecliptic and so is subject to lunar occultations. The star is eclipsed by the sun from about 1-4 March; thus the star can be viewed the whole night, crossing the sky, in early September, in the current epoch.

2281,"Urethral intercourse or coitus per urethram is sexual penetration of the female urethra by an object such as a penis or a finger.  It is not the same thing as urethral sounding, the act of inserting a specialized medical tool into the urethra as a form of sexual or fetishistic activity. The untrained insertion of foreign bodies into the urethra carries a significant risk that subsequent medical attention may be required.  Documented cases of urethral intercourse appear to have occurred between heterosexual couples;  a survey of the global medical literature available in 1965 reported accounts of thirteen separate cases. By 2014, 26 cases had been documented in the medical literature, many in people with Müllerian dysgenesis who were engaging in urethral intercourse unknowingly. However, the stretching of the urethra required by this form of intercourse has also reportedly resulted in a complete and permanent loss of urethral sphincter control (urinary incontinence); furthermore such intercourse presents a very high risk of bladder infection to the receptive partner. It can also lead to permanent dilation of the urethra and incontinence during intercourse. Presenting symptoms of unintentional urethral intercourse include primary infertility, dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), and incontinence. More serious consequences include evisceration via the urethra and bladder rupture.",0

2287,"Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is a class of amorphous carbon material that displays some of the typical properties of diamond. DLC is usually applied as coatings to other materials that could benefit from such properties. DLC exists in seven different forms. All seven contain significant amounts of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms. The reason that there are different types is that even diamond can be found in two crystalline polytypes. The more common one uses a cubic lattice, while the less common one, lonsdaleite, has a hexagonal lattice. By mixing these polytypes at the nanoscale, DLC coatings can be made that at the same time are amorphous, flexible, and yet purely sp3 bonded ""diamond"". The hardest, strongest, and slickest is tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C). Ta-C can be considered to be the ""pure"" form of DLC, since it consists almost entirely of sp3 bonded carbon atoms. Fillers such as hydrogen, graphitic sp2 carbon, and metals are used in the other 6 forms to reduce production expenses or to impart other desirable properties.",0

It also is responsible for managing the application and audition process for potential navy musicians. Personnel from the FBA work directly with the Bureau of Naval Personnel to meet our musician requirements for the fleet. History of navy bands 
The earliest pieces of military music in the United States Navy was the Shantyman's Song, which often helped in boosting the morale of sailors and developing a culture based on shipboard life. Later came trumpeters, drummers and fifers who were carried on the early frigates to sound calls, give general orders, and perform at funerals and other ceremonies. They eventually gained a role as a separate section of the crew on many Navy vessels. Shore-based bands in the 19th century led to the creation of the Naval Academy Band, which grew in importance during the American Civil War. Other band units afloat and ashore played a major role in promoting the morale of sailors and civilians alike. At the start of World War I many civilian musicians left their famous orchestras and joined the Navy as well as other services of the United States Armed Forces, using their trade to contribute to the war effort. MUS1, a 45-piece regimental band led by notable James Benton Parsons, was composed of the first blacks to serve in the modern Navy at rank higher than messman. The first of a series of fleet music schools were established in 1903 in Virginia in an effort to improve the training and performance of navy bands. B-1 was replaced at Manana in October 1945 as its men mustered out and returned to the states by a 17-piece band that included future jazz great John Coltrane.",0
